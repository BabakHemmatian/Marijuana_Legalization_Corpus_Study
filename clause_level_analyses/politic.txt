This is probably one of the reasons why the city council recently voted to lower the penalty for possession of small amounts of marijuana.

Don't believe too much during election season.any peoplePredict that he will say, in October, he wants to Legalize pot.

This is my city and I am very disappointed. The Long Beach City Council did a great job of regulating medical marijuana dispensaries... *after* doing a not so great job and getting slapped with a law suit that was taken all the way to the CA Supreme Court. In the end, after much pressure from the community, the LBCC voted in February to allow 18 medical marijuana dispensaries to operate, and gave the Long Beach Police Department their blessing to go after the unlawful dispensaries. (One of the highlights of the several City Council meetings covering the medical marijuana dispensaries was a Council member shutting down the Long Beach City Attorney. The LB city attorney is a bitter old man and at the city council meetings regarding the dispensaries he continued to make one point and one point only: "it will be easiest to just shut them all down and ban them." He kept saying that over and over, anytime a council member asked him "well if we do this, is that legal?" and finally one council woman said "We are not looking for the easiest thing to do here! We're looking to find a solution that will work for the city residents!" And they did successfully come to a solution that ensured Long Beach residents continue to have legal access to their legal medication. I was quite proud, actually.)Anyway, using this kind of excessive force is NEVER okay and I have written my council member asking her to stress to the LBPD that the city council does NOT condone the use of excessive force in dispensary raids.

>Leonhart presumably was referring to recent increases in drug use measured by the federal government's National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The share of Americans 12 and older reporting past-year use of illegal drugs (overwhelmingly marijuana) in this survey was 15.1 percent last year. That's barely more than the 14.9 percent rate found when the survey began in 2002, but it is nine-tenths of a percentage point more than the 2008 number (a 6 percent increase!). According to Leonhart, all the talk about legalizing pot provoked by California's Proposition 19, which qualified for the ballot in March 2010 and was defeated a couple of weeks ago, somehow drove up marijuana use in 2009. Forget about whether that's plausible; it's not even logically possible.Ahahaha, oh wow. She's talking about a percentage increase *of a percentage*. Which in this case is fucking *nothing*.Nothing to see here, just more "statistics".

I'm white and have been arrested twice for pot. Myth busted.

Basically, Trained Economists would use policies to encourage the things we want(clean environment, good working conditions) and tax the things we want to discourage(pollution, over consumption).1) Get rid of the Mortgage Deduction. 2) Get rid of the Healthcare Deduction.3) Get rid of the Corporate Income Tax.4) Eliminate Income and Payroll Taxes.5) Institute "Consumption Tax" AKA Sin Taxes (Carbon Tax, Gas Tax, Energy Use Tax.6) Legalize Marijuana.

LEGAL TO SELL?Obviously not cannabis. Spice has nothing to do with marijuana or THC.

Yep, and the White House would do with it what they have done with all of the legalize cannabis petitions. Nothing.

So we're supposed to suspend disbelief and just accept that:A.) The police could pat him down twice, find a tiny bag of weed and not find a 6 inch long, 2 inch wide handgun.B.) Chavis Carter was a contortionistC.) The dashboard cam could capture the frisking, and actions before the "suicide", and the moment after the "suicide" but was off during the actual event? Aren't these things running the whole time?D.) No mention of gsr on his hands at all in the examiners report. How could there not be gsr? He's in the backseat of a cop car, with a seat behind him and a solid wall in front of him. It's enclosed, there would obviously be gsr on him.The kid was executed. I'm almost more angry about the medical examiners office and the police thinking we're all dumb enough to believe their lame ass story than the murder itself.I hope the FBI gets involved, and these "protectors of the peace" find out the real meaning of getting frisked in jail.

Pass legislation repealing the federal requirement that the Federal Attorney general not discuss anything but keeping it prohibited.Yeah, Eric Holder's fucking hands are tied until we do that.That is, until that section of the law is struck down, the Federal government cannot *legally* discuss marijuana from position but that of keeping it illegal.

As a liberal, I am against pot as well. I think it should remain illegal, but let's make smoking illegal too

Libertarian candidate for president. He served as a Republican Governor of New Mexico for 8 years (in a 2:1 blue state), brought a $1b deficit to a $1b surplus, allowed for the creation of 20,000 jobs (without creating a single job himself). His nickname was Governor Veto because he vetoed more bills (mostly spending increase-related) than all 49 other state governors combined.He wants to balance the budget *now*, end the wars and bring our troops home, end the drug war through legalization of cannabis (treating it like alcohol), reform Medicare and Medicaid to run more efficiently, and implement the more efficient [Fair Tax](http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer?pagename=HowFairTaxWorks).He also climbs mountains (including Mt. Everest), competes in triathlons, and turned a 1-man handyman business into a 1000 person corporation.Oh. And if the race was based solely on the issues, he would win the presidency (according to the Isidewith results).

I hope the bans by international community will finally shift US farmers away from GM products so that Us consumers are also spared.The FDA won't help us.If you still don't know GM corn is made to be able to internally store huge quantities of Roundup weed and bug killer which you then EAT. That's one reason it is so bad for you. You are eating weed and bug killer when you eat GM corn.Non GM corn can't tolerate that much weed and bug killer so it isn't used during growing and is much safer to eat.

Yeah, but they made pot legal and look what happened.Crime and violence dropped like a rock.

Marijuana is an interesting example of what happens when a populace just decides to ignore a law they do not agree with.Now, people still rot in jail for pot and that's bull, but how many crimes can you commit where most people you know will a) commit that crime with you and b) don't even consider it a crime.We have made pot semi-legal just by ignoring the rule against it.We can do this with all laws, we have that ability.

Why is it always former police not active police that are for changing the drug laws? How much money in overtime, salary, and now a pension did he earn that was funded from the prohibition of marijuana, and now he is against it. It just seems hypocritical that he should be taken seriously.

Denver proves nothing. Colorado is nothing more than a RED STATE wearing a BLUE COAT. Adolf Coors will NEVER ALLOW pot to be anywhere near legalized in the state of Colorado. To them it means competition.

To be fair, the cops are all out frisking brown people for **MARIJUANA** (cue: camera zooms in and out, ominous music in background).
