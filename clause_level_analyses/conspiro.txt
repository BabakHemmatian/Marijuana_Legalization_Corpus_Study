With all the things we've got to worry about, and our Justice Department should be doing, that probably shouldn't be a high priority." (June 2, 2007, town hall meeting in Laconia, New Hampshire) "The Justice Department going after sick individuals using [marijuana] as a palliative instead of going after serious criminals makes no sense."

(responding to whether the federal government should stop medical marijuana raids, August 13, 2007, town hall meeting in Nashua, New Hampshire) "I would not have the Justice Department prosecuting and raiding medical marijuana users. It's not a good use of our resources." (August 21, 2007, event in Nashua, New Hampshire) "My attitude is if the science and the doctors suggest that the best palliative care and the way to relieve pain and suffering is medical marijuana then that's something I'm open to because there's no difference between that and morphine when it comes to just giving people relief from pain. But I want to do it under strict guidelines. I want it prescribed in the same way that other painkillers or palliative drugs are prescribed." (November 24, 2007 town hall meeting in Iowa)

**[staunchneocon](/u/staunchneocon)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dk791/a/c9rej8k) She let cops into her home, and admitted to having marijuana in the home with a felon and child. She already admitted to breaking the law. She is stupid. For those claiming there is no marijuana, please read the effing article: http://www.adn.com/2013/05/01/2886908/trooper-arrest-under-investigation.html

**[staunchneocon](/u/staunchneocon)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dk791/a/c9rf6hg) &gt;She never admitted to having marijuana. The cops SAW THE MARIJUANA IN THE HOUSE. It what they are discussing at the beginning of the video. http://www.adn.com/2013/05/01/2886908/trooper-arrest-under-investigation.html Did you even watch the video? It starts with them discussing having marijuana in the house which she *admits to!*. She then elaborates by saying it doesn't belong to her mom (the felon). You don't say 'it's not hers' if you are talking about something that doesn't exist. the cop repeatedly talks about having marijuana in the house, which she doesn't even attempt to deny. They are both operating under the assumption that the presence of marijuana is not in contest. This video, if used in court, will be her downfall.

**[staunchneocon](/u/staunchneocon)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dk791/a/c9rfu8e) Save your personal insults. They only highlight how lacking in logic your argument is. At several points in the video she acknowledges that she has marijuana in the house. Just the act of saying 'it's not hers' is an admission of possession, by default. Furthermore, the cops SAW MARIJUANA IN THE HOUSE. That is what they are discussing at the beginning of the video: http://www.adn.com/2013/05/01/2886908/trooper-arrest-under-investigation.html

**[chamaelleon](/u/chamaelleon)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dk791/a/c9rfuia) Maybe you were watching a different video. What I heard was the cop saying he *smelled* marijuana, and the girl retorting that smelling marijuana is not proof of its presence. And, yes, you can logically deny ownership of something that doesn't exist. For example, if someone here were to ask which of us has the stolen car, double parked in two handicap spaces, guess what I'm gonna say? It's not mine. I don't even know if said car exists, but I'm gonna say it's not mine. And if you ask me if it belongs to my mom, I'm gonna say it's not hers either. Still don't know if the car exists, but it ain't my moms, and it ain't mine.

**[staunchneocon](/u/staunchneocon)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dk791/a/c9rfy1p) Sigh. Maybe you only listened to tiny pieces of the video. Feel free to go back and actually listen to their entire conversation. She admits there is marijuana in the house, and simpy denies it belongs to her mom. If a cop asks "who's weed is that?", anyone say "It's not my mom's", that is, by default, an admission of it's existence. Unless you are ESL, or not yet in high school, you should be ashamed for not understanding this simple fact.

She said that it wasn't her mothers (the person with the felony). The police were there for one reason, to make sure everyone was safe, not to interrogate her. Regardless of how you feel she was being a "jerk" that is NOT AGAINST THE LAW! He pushed her (which is assault) plain and simple, and I know you wanna think that ok cause she was such a bitch to them....but it's NOT.

All these help to insure no one even wants to affect the system anymore and eventually, forget there even is a system except for "election" day. tl:dr you're tellling me if 20 percent of the population voted 3rd party next election cycle, nothing would happen?

Having multiple sexual partners is just fine, having kids with dozens of women is also fine, but legally marrying a second woman and extending to them the right of a spouse/family, that's illegal. Seems legit! Most Dems shit their pants when asked about polygamy. — Its all just a sham to distract people from more pressing issues anyways. It is a based on pure emotionalism. Look at this way, how many people in the US are gay? Probably not even 10%. And out of those who are, how many actually want to get married? You'll soon realize its an issue that affects only a few thousand or hundred thousand people at most (in a nation of 316 million)! Now compare that with how many people are affected by the Patriot Act, marijuana prohibition &amp; Drug War, CISPA, NDAA'12, wars abroad, blowback, the TSA, FCC, FDA, so on and so forth.... Yet for some reason the entire nation is divided &amp; fighting over gay-marriage (which doesn't even affect them either side of the debate) but they pay no attention to actual laws/legislation that *does* affect them!

**[destraht](/u/destraht)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dv56a/a/c9uftf9) I do know the future but the crystal ball distorts the timeline a bit. I monetize it by applying technology. I learned second hand how the government shuts people down when my friend had his marijuana seized by a cop. The cop told him that he would likely walk but that it didn't matter because he was never getting his $10k+ stash back and that he would likely be put out of business. So it started out with three felony counts against him and went to a misdemeanor, a $100 fine and no probation. Also look at AMD vs Intel. AMD received billions there and in the end it was shit because they were nearly squeezed out of the market by monopolistic activity. Being in the market is everything.

**[board4life](/u/board4life)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dwu5h/a/c9ur42x) http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause While I do agree with the legislation, and feel things like hemp, marijuana (medical or recreational), other non-dangerous (i.e not meth and heroin) drugs should be left to the states to decide, and the DEA should focus on drugs that are illegal by state law, or traffickers, the Supremacy Clause gives the feds the top spot. Yes its shitty (can be argued unconstitutional as an overreach of power), but isn't it beautiful how the bill of rights can get tossed in the shitter because the feds don't like people having rights like free speech and guns and protection from unlawful search and seizure, but the clauses they like they keep. I think while we're doing this whole "reinterpreting" of the constitution (the argument about the founding fathers not being able to envision AR-15 style rifles), we should also be able to reinterpret our system of government, since it is now so big it is simply in the business of sustaining itself.

**[ANewMachine615](/u/ANewMachine615)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dwu5h/a/c9uqp8r) The thing is, if a law is unconstitutional, then nullification is impossible, because the law is already void. If the law is constitutional, then nullification is impossible because of federal supremacy. Given that current jurisprudence allows the regulation of hemp under Congress's commerce power, there's no nullification going on here, just a state passing a law that can't be enforced.

**[ANewMachine615](/u/ANewMachine615)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dwu5h/a/c9v0j0r) &gt;Either way I think this is an assertion that the state is refusing to enforce this federal law, which may make your wording a little inaccurate That would actually be perfectly legal, under Printz v. US. However, that's not nullification, since the federal government could still enforce that law, just as the feds can raid licensed dispensaries in states with medical marijuana laws. This law purports to license legal hemp growing. Fact is, though, that has no effect whatsoever on the federal law banning hemp growing, therefor there is no "nullification" at work here. But you're right, my language was too broad -- I was thinking back to the Kansas attempt to exempt their firearms from federal regulations, and to bar federal officers from enforcing those regs. ETA: Because I'd been in a discussion on that topic on another forum, that is.

**[NoGodsNoMastersEsq](/u/NoGodsNoMastersEsq)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dzj2d/a/c9vgrlg) State laws that purport to "nullify" federal ones are unconstitutional. In the last week, I've posted a couple times in /r/conspiracy about why this is so in threads about an attempt in Kansas to nullify federal laws as well as a thread about Colorado industrial hemp that was being misunderstood(the Colorado law didn't even claim it effected nullification, but /r/conspiracy posters were claiming it did anyway). Every time I've explained why, giving the provisions of our federal constitution and citations to case law that are the reason why states cannot do this, I get downvoted severely and get a bunch of dumb responses from people who do not recognize the power of the US Supreme Court to interpret what the Constitution means, something which has been a dead issue for most people since Marbury v. Madison.

**[George_Hayduke](/u/George_Hayduke)**: [^^original ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dyu73/a/c9vf5l5) Also, I'm pretty sure it actually is legal to grow hemp, just typically not marijuana.

Three women get brutalized for a decade and police ignore it, but they have the SWAT team kick peoples doors in if they think they might seize a decent amount of marijuana? Fuck everything about this. We pay their salaries, and we should have the control to tell them what crimes that they should be policing.

**[TRC042](/u/TRC042)**: [^^original ^^reddit ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1e1tmq/a/c9vzx6r) Good points. It's the "slippery slope" aspect that troubles me: Use the power to track serious threats today, and it expands to include petty crimes tomorrow. The feds have already used Homeland Security wiretap data to arrest 2,000 pot growers. While that's not petty crime, it sure isn't in the same league as bombing a city. The threat of a run on junk food just isn't that much of a national security issue. ;)

Now, I don't know about you, but I don't just take a fucking blog post at face value, so I went ahead and clicked on their source, where it clearly says cannabis sativa. Being rich in THC isn't the whole story. Please find the link and read the study. I promise it won't take more than 5 minutes of your time. And among educated cannabis users, it is quite difficult to come across sativa dominant strains unless you're a medical user. Why? Sativa grows tall, thin, and doesn't produce nearly as much as an indica strain, which is short and very dense. Why is this important? Because illegal growers don't want obvious towering plants that also yield a far lower amount of smokeable cannabis, thus reduced profits.

Joking aside though, this quote is stupid. There are gun laws so we can prosecute crimes that can involve harming other people, where as doing drugs (even weed) only hurts yourself. Not to mention, even in colorado where dope is pretty much legal, dispensaries' main concern is competing with the black market once the taxation is implemented. There is still a black market for moonshine, for instance.

**[JanRandall](/u/JanRandall)**: [^^original ^^reddit ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1efyru/a/ca0fque/?1eg4fc) Why does our society require marijuana to cure some illness before they'll consider legalizing it? Shame the same treatment wasn't applied to the man made poison that makes people aggressive, violent and prone to blackouts. Why is a naturally occurring substance that at a minimum, generally causes relaxation and feelings of joy made out to be such a bad thing?
