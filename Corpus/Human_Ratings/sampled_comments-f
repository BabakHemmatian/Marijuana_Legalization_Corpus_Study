> it's safer to drive on pot than on alcohol Actually, there's a good bit of evidence to back that up: "The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08" - *U.S. D.O.T. study* "There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance" - *University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales* "THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs (Robbe, 1994; Robbe and O'Hanlon, 1995; O'Hanlon et al., 1995)" - *University of Limburg, Netherlands* "There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected" - *University of Adelaide, South Australia* "marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident" - *University of Toronto, Canada* "In two studies with reasonable numbers of individuals who had only used cannabis, there was no clear evidence of increased culpability in these drivers." - *The Lancet* "No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis" - *Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute* "Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving" - *Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs* "In terms of road safety, it cannot be concluded that driving under the influence [of marijuana] is not a hazard [...] In comparison with alcohol however, the severe effects of alcohol on driving are likely to make this more of a hazard" - *Road Safety Division Report, UK*

The US's military has been the reason for the US influence all over the world. It is the reason the whole of Europe joined you in two illegal wars in the middle east. It's the reason weed has been illegal all over the world. It's the reason the US gets really good trade deals in the ME and South America. The US has used it's military power as a source of influence. With Trump that influence is gone because the US can no longer be trusted to aid allies. As a result, the EU is looking into having a combined army rather than a bunch of small ones for individual countries.

There are 99 reasons to hate Newt Gingrich.Here's one:He supported the death penalty for marijuana trafficking.Stop. This isn't about whether or not you think marijuana should be legal. I said he supported the **death penalty** for marijuana trafficking.Did you get that? No, I didn't just say he supported sending people to *prison* for marijuana trafficking. I said **death penalty**.The fucking **death penalty**He is a fucking psychopath.

You should read about [what really happened in this case](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm)>McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. **Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees**.And >Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at **185 degrees**, plus or minus five degrees. **He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat.** The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.McDonald's admitted to making a dangerous product. That's why they're liable.

>the 10th amendment gives states the right to make a law about anything that the federal government has not already addressed.The 10th amendment limits federal power to those grated specifically by the US Constitution and gives all other rights to the states and people. Federal laws and constitutional amendments are not the same thing.>States are not allowed to violate any federal laws in their policy making... and thus the Supreme Court ruled the state's can't make laws that go against the federal laws.Due process and equal protection are about the equal enforcement of the law for all citizens in order to prevent discrimination. It has nothing at all to do with state laws having to follow federal laws. Also, constitutional amendments are created by congress and guide the courts, not ruled on by courts.>It is still possible to legalize marijuana. In fact I highly doubt there is any federal law on the subject.[Facepalm!](http://norml.org/index.cfm?wtm_view=&Group_ID=4575)

I mean it would be silly to try to eliminate a black market by taxing it like that, it would just keep the black market going. The price of marijuana as a whole would go down so I guess the taxing would all be relative. The business owners trying to profit from the new laws would not go for a tax like that, there would be no incentive to open up shop.

It doesn't say they *have* to try opiates. It says that the doctor can recommend medical marijuana if either A) Regular medical therapies and opiates don't seem to work or B) regular medical therapies and opiates are contraindicated (meaning it would either be harmful or isn't worth looking into because the costs would outweigh the benefits. This also prevents a doctor from becoming a legalized naturopath who could dismiss patients by telling them to just get stoned instead of trying real proven medical treatments first.

The cost of weed doesn't come from the cost of production, if you could grow it legally you could produce it as cheaply as you do any outdoor plant. The cost of business comes from having to avoid detection, creating a smaller supply and a greater risk which requires a larger profit to entice one to grow. You could get low quality seeds for damn near free, all it takes is time.

The drug industry doesn't thrive on interpersonal violence, interpersonal violence is imposed on it by the criminalisation of otherwise harmless activities. Growing weed in a cupboard has nothing to do with violence. Stamping pills from powder has nothing to do with violence. Selling things to people has nothing to do with violence.

The problem is that the definition of "Liberalism" in America is far different than it is in the rest of the world. In America, European "Liberalism" is called "Classical Liberalism". I would bet most American Liberals would not define themselves as Classical Liberals. Classical Liberalism is about individualism (free market, anti-nanny state) while American Liberalism is more about legalizing pot and pushing a welfare-state agenda.

Israel occupies East Jerusalem, and illegally annexed it back in the 1970's or 80's. The world does not recognize Israel's claim to East Jerusalem and it pisses off the Palestinians because they want it to be their capital. By moving its embassy to Jerusalem, the US would be recognizing Israel's claim and thus stirring up a pot that is already boiling.

No, they simply indicate the truth. The easiest crime to actually convict on is drug charges. You actually need a witness and evidence to convict for armed robbery, however you just need a gram of pot in order to convict on narcotics charges. Do you really think that a guy who has multiple charges relating to assault and burglary just assaulted and robbed one person each?

>Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;http://drugabuse.gov/infofacts/marijuana.htmlRemember, whatever goes into the mother's body goes into the baby's.

Preflop:Given that we have a preflop raiser UTG, typically this represents a strong hand, let's say top 10%. Now your thought process should be "What hands will call the UTG raiser?" In a multiway pot like this, you have to call $180 to win $795, with one person behind you. That's about 4.5 to 1 odds. If we assume that both players in the pot have top 10% hands, then the odds of you winning are around the same, 21.3%. With your stack at 70ish BB, this is a fine place to call.The Flop:This is a bad place to lead. Think - what hands are your opponents representing? UTG can have pocket pairs, AK,AQ, AT at worst. since you are drawing better than most of these hands, a check call makes a lot more sense here. Why force yourself to pay to see a card when you are behind? What would you have done if you get reraised all in? Your raise here doesn't push off very many hands, and the hands that call you are way ahead of you. However, given that the UTG folded, He likely had a low pocket pair, AJ, AQ, AK, KQ. Then Villain calls. Using the same logic as before, what is he calling with? AT makes sense as played, same with other face cards with a ten. A straight draw is unlikely, given that 78/89 is not calling the UTG raise too often. Sets make sense here since if it were JJ or better, and we likely would have seen a reraise preflop.The Turn:You hit the 7, which also shows a straight draw. Given our analysis from the previous hands, the only hands you can beat here are A5 and A6, which are both unlikely hands and they aren't going to call another raise anyway. As played, you can represent a straight draw as a bluff, but how often do you have exactly 89 here? In addition, a half pot raise is too small if that was your strategy. By now, it is obvious that you are representing a weak hand here. You either have a one pair, going for a flush draw, still have 1 to a straight, or you played TT very interestingly. The villain here should shove and punish your raise with their set, but they let you draw to a flush.The river:Congrats, you beat the odds and made the flush? What will you do? The only thing you can do is value bet here. Every hand we've put the Villain on now is going to check back. There is no value in the Villain betting since you will only call with stronger hands and will fold weaker hands. Given the hands we put the Villain on by now, I think a low bet size makes sense. About 1/3 to 1/4 pot.Overall, I think this hand should check call the flop, check call the turn and either shove the river or check raise the river (which is more likely to bet when you play this way). But it's likely that you get bet off this hand on the flop or turn, which is okay because you aren't going to river the flush often enough to call a shove.

Do you have any evidence that contradicts that? Otherwise, "Wow, just wow," doesn't add much to the discussion. There is no good evidence to suggest there are SERIOUS negative health effects to long term cannabis use. You'll probably be able to find some poorly done studies that conclude there are negative health risks, but any legitimate study concludes there is no serious damage in long term use.

Back in the late 80's as I was working at about 3 am in a knitting mill in a small town with my buddy and we're alone staring out the window bored. All of a sudden this guy comes running out of the apartment about 100 ft away with a couple of old open cardboard boxes. He literally throws them without looking into the back seat of his car slams the door and runs around and jumps into the drivers seat and rips out of there tires spinning. All this is in the span of about 15 seconds including the time of coming down the stairs of the building he was in.About 40 seconds later the house is surrounded by about 5 police cars with their blues all on and they proceed to surround the house, pounding on the door of the apartment he came out of and shining flashlights into the window.Found out the next day from the grapevine the guy was selling small amounts of weed and it was a drug bust and someone had called him less than 3 minutes before the bust was supposed to happen and if he had been even 30 seconds later he would have been arrested. We just stood there looking out the windows of the factories second floor staring for like 10 minutes before we remembered, "we were baked", that the knitting machines were still running.

But we couldn't know that it was a rightful murder (in self-defense) before he was convicted or acquitted. Therefore, he is innocent until proven guilty - just like with smoking pot. The act may be illegal, but simply committing the act isn't enough to be a criminal - you also have to be proven guilty in a court of law. A criminal is someone "guilty of a crime", and you aren't guilty until you're proven to be.

I just looked it up, and you have to be 18 years or older to use cannabis. You are only allowed to have upto 5 grams for personal use. Having 5 to 30 grams will give you a fine of 75 euro's. If you have more than 30 grams you will be prosecuted, with a maximum punishment of 2 years to prison. If you use any under the age of 18 however, you will have to do a community service between 16 to 30 hours.

I can grow a few plants outside and get over a pound per plant for maybe $20 in water and nutrients. Once you start getting higher numbers and buy nutrients in bulk that price can drop substantially. You can grow it for less than one cent per gram and it will be as good as anything grown indoors. The on reason cannabis is so expensive is its legal status and nothing more. After its legalised and big crops are legally grown outdoors like tobacco the price will drop to around $5 a gram as it will be taxed to shit and everyone will want to get a cut of the massive profits available. For the medicinal scene it could drop to less than $1 a gram for perfectly grown and controlled hydroponic buds if its run as a non-profit industry.

No. [Federal law always supersedes state law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause), assuming the federal government is exercising enumerated powers (which are generally pretty broad).Although the interplay of federal and local law is a [little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption) more [complicated](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/preemption.htm) than this, basically Constitution > Duly Ratified Treaties > Federal Statutes > State Constitutions > State Statutes > County/Municipal Codes. This should make sense intuitively as well, if individual states could supersede federal authority (usually called [nullification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_%28U.S._Constitution%29)), the whole political system would fly apart rather quickly. Generally speaking, states retain autonomy to enact laws in any way they see fit if they are outside of the enumerated powers of the federal government, or in policy areas where the federal government may have power, but has not exercised it or has exercised in a way so as not to preempt existing state laws, as long as they aren't running into other constitutional issues (usually [most, at least](http://www.redwoods.edu/instruct/klee/billofrights.htm), of the federal bill of rights).Since the Supreme Court deemed that denying same sex couples the right to marry violates the federal constitution, the states con no longer do so. However, since the federal government still deems the production and possession of marijuana to be illegal, you can still face federal charges even in a state where possession/production has been legalized. > This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.

Almost every Jungler(aside from Merc AFAIK) buys red pot/purple pot. Merc gets Sprint because its like red pot, except cheaper and infinite uses.Most junglers standard build is Warrior Boots > Jotuns > Mail of Renewal/Spirit Robe. I can't think of a Jungler you want Fatalis or Lifesteal on that early. Some want Deathbringer third, but in general it sounds like you are building too much offense too little defense.Jungler Start:* Speed with Solo* Blue with Solo* Go to Mid and join Mid to Clear a Wave* Do a Mid camp. If the enemy is there fight if you have advantage otherwise go to other camp.* Clear Wave.* Do other Mid Camp if up. Clear Wave after. Otherwise skip this step.* Do a Back camp(any of the 4, though only do enemy ones if you want to fight their Mid/Jungle or know they went to the camp your not going too).* Go Mid and Clear Wave.* Do another back camp.Note: Inbetween every camp after you hit mid you get the wave. The wave gives substantially more gold/XP than camps, especially Harpies.At this point you can back for items or go mid. Blue, Red, and Mid harpies should all be coming up and you can look at going for one of those(I like Blue>Mid>Speed) IF there is no opportunity to gank. You can of course interrupt the above for Ganks, but thats the default pattern that should leave you good on farm. In general try to be in a lane when not doing a buff camp or ganking to soak XP. I regularly top Gold as Jungle and I think its because I don't see a lot of Junglers who have the farm timings down at all. Note that at the the Support should be rotating to mid for Second Mid Harpies and becomes kind of a second jungler. They shouldn't be trying to solo camps(not that they can't, its just their clear is so bad by this points it takes too long), but if you see a gank opportunity see if you can call them over.smitejunkies.com has all of team eNvy(formerly AFK) posting builds. I have yet to use a build from there and have it be anything less than awesome.

Well, if you truly want to know I applaud you.1) Because, for example, Christianity has directly lead to killings, in the form of say, the crusades2) Because, for example, Christianity promotes so much fear in the guise of "Satan", directly leading to such intense extreme fear in people that they were willing to burn others to death as "pagans" and "witches" from the 1400-1700AD, and many Christians I know still fear "pagans" and "witches" today.3) Because, for example, Christians seem to fear direct experience. Easier to label others pagans and witches than explore the more rational truth that they were pioneers exploring consciousness using entheogens (*) to reboot the mind/ego. *hallucinigens... from the Greek "entheos" and "genesthai". "Entheos" meaning "Full of the god, inspired, possessed, "That which causes God to be within and individual". 4) Because these unchecked fears are the direct cause of science woefully failing to explore entheogens for medicinal and healing use, and instead immediately Schedule 1 them, directly leading to the US War on Drugs and imprisonment of its citizens. Witness the current assault on Salvia, which followed marijuana, peyote, psilocyben These fears demonize the shamans and mystics of cultures who use them.5) Because these fears deny all of us our very freedom of consciousness, of freedom of cognitive libertyhttp://www.cognitiveliberty.org/6) Because, it seems to me, Christians would rather take responsibility out of their hands (ala Satan) rather than the hard work of identifying and fixing long term deep seated emotional problems and fears that we all have. It seems many christians are afraid of meditation, because "demons" may enter. Yes, "demons" are fears, and yes, they will enter and that's OK.7) Because these deep seated fears are the cause of wars, prejudice, and homophobia, reducing civil rights and human rights for us all8) Because modern day Christianity seems to be mostly binary and deeply polarizing, and it has blinded not only religious zealots but scientific zealots. For example, it has caused many scientists-- Dawkins, Reddit atheists to adopt a similarly binary and deeply reactionary polarizing stance, such that science itself is now mostly useless and corrupted looking at all the wrong problems. Because Christianity and its overzealous missionaries have caused the pendulum to swing too far and caused a world of what I can only call extreme "science" -- a science that is no longer integral or whole, a science with a distain for philosophy. A science that for the most part ignores the study of consciousness as a "soft science" and not worthy as science. 9) Because Christianity (and reactionary science) promotes mostly Black and White literal non integral thinking. No shades of gray.10) Because Christianity (and reactionary science) cannot accept or understand 1 = 0. If you are a Christian or a scientist who understands, I apologize for the generalization.

When I was 16, with only a learner's permit, I stole my dad's car and went for a joyride one night. Me and a friend, riding around at midnight, with cheap champagne and an ounce of weed. In a rather upscale part of town, I suddenly saw I was running a red light and slammed on the brakes, coming to a screeching halt in the middle of an intersection. We looked over to see -- a cop car sitting there watching the whole thing. He followed me all the way home (2 miles) and left when he saw me in the driveway. Jebus. I had to remove the car seat cover from my anus.

You have it backwards. It absolutely is NOT physically addictive, it MAY be psychologically addictive to SOME people. To the point of it being a "gateway drug" - no, it's not. The "gateway" is DARE and programs like it telling us from a young age that all drugs will either make you go insane, make you so addicted you'll turn to crime to support your habit, straight up kill you, or any combination of those things. Then when those kids smoke weed for the first time and realize everything they've been told about THAT drug is bullshit, they assume EVERYTHING they've been told about ALL drugs is bullshit, leading to having an extreme openness to try other drugs.TL;DR: DARE is the real gateway drug and we should stop lying to our kids and trying to scare them away from drugs, and should START being honest instead.

I apologize, I really wasn't trying to suggest Joseph Smith wrote the book because I know you don't believe that. I meant to include another sentence in there but lost my train of thought a bit. I didn't realize that what was said about the church was supposedly from God in the First Vision. I think that 1 Nephi 13 in light of the First Vision would suggest that the entire Christian church was corrupted as soon as it brought in the Gentiles. Supposedly God said, "all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom."All churches and their professors were "corrupt", and "all their creeds were an abomination in his sight.As a confessional Lutheran who confesses the historic creeds of the Christian church this is troublesome, especially since the creeds are based on scripture. I have trouble understanding how people think God would just let things run amuck for almost 2000 years in the church that he founded. Why found a church and have that preach the gospel to the Gentiles only to have the whole thing go to pot?

Sure, if you release ten minorities imprisoned for selling pot (and other victimless crimes), one could be a real criminal. So what is the solution for real criminals committing real crimes? The answer is to catch them with real police work, not just dragnet sweeping up pot dealers in the off chance one might be a real criminal.So the question is, what are the odds the police will improve and start catching real criminals committing real crimes?

What's the difference?easy access to birth control literature, condoms and diaphragms was blamed for sexual promiscuity. Easy access to alcohol was blamed for a bunch of social problems. Easy access to all sorts of literature from Darwin, to Lady Chatterley's Lover to Harry Potter has been blamed for obscenity, immorality and sorcery. Easy access to marijuana and cocaine was blamed for lazy Mexicans and sexual promiscuity (again), easy access to porn is blamed for rape and violence against women, easy access to video games was blamed for teenaged violence, easy access to ru486 and HPV vaccine is being blamed for sexual promiscuity*."easy access" is just a euphemism for "we need to ban this"(*seems like sex is a fearful thing for many...)

>If an officer claims to smell marijuana in your car and requests a search, can that be considered probable or reasonable cause for the officer to act?Yes.>Also, along the same lines, what constitutes a "search"? Is it legal for a cop to shine his flashlight into your car without consent?Yes; that's the plain view doctrine.>In my small town, the bullying police officers always seem to use that tactic (whether there is actually marijuana to be smelled or not.)You should complain and take them to court.

No, you totally missed the point. I'm saying no excuse is required. Your opinion of him is completely misinformed and your right to judge him is based on your belief that everyone should live up to what you think is an acceptable standard. I am saying that Cannabis has absolutely nothing to do with it. You just now said so yourself. He has been a lazy person for years. He is just a lazy person, probably always will be. Make Cannabis disappear, he will still be lazy and will not live up to what you think is "acceptable."See here is the thing with people like you. You are so self-righteous and judgmental, you think it's your place to run around telling other people how to live or what is acceptable. So you support laws and policies that harm people just because you have an opinion. The truth is that this guys life is none of your damn business at all. What he does with his life is completely out of your control. Your idea of his "excessive" pot use is based on zero ability to judge. You call this guy your friend. But you are not his fucking friend. You want him to conform to some standards you have set which are based on pre-suppositions that are entirely incorrect because your mental frame is based on your worldview - therefore he does not conform to them. In fact, those who walk around thinking they know better than others, make plain their real ignorance. It becomes clear that they have not yet learned that different people see the world differently, and that their perspective is not the "right" perspective. It is just your perspective. It has no bearing on his life. His perspective is different. And so is his parents. You think he shouldn't live with his parents - they think he should. You are wrong to say otherwise because you don't know all.You think he should work harder - they think he is fine. You are wrong to say otherwise because you don't know all.You think he is lazy - they think it is acceptable. You are wrong to say otherwise because you don't know all.You think his Cannabis use is bad - they think it's a fine idea. You are wrong to say otherwise because you don't know all.If you had all of the information, only then you **might** be able to make a clear opinion. But you don't. So all this judging of his actions only further demonstrates your ignorance.By expressing your disapproval, you are only tearing down his self-esteem. You are making him feel he is not "enough." If you really want to be his friend, don't make him feel this way. Leave him alone. Accept him for who he is. If you cannot accept him then you should just stay away from him altogether. Hang out with people you accept. But, knowing people like you, you probably don't really accept anyone. You are always trying to change people. You find things to complain about the people around you. People are pushed away from you because it is likely you make everyone feel like they are not enough. I'm not judging you. You can be however you want. But just in case you identify with this, I thought you might want to know so you can decide what to do about it.

TLDR at the endThe definition of a Schedule I narcotic is that it has “no currently accepted medical use, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, **and** a high potential for abuse.” schedules II-V are varying degrees of medical use and abuse potential which are as follows:II-high potential for abuse that can lead to psychological/physical dependence. III-a potential for abuse less than substances in Schedules I or II and abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.IV-a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule III.V-a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV (consists primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics)[Source (the DEA’s website)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/) There is not a single person alive who can make a compelling argument that pot should be classified as a Schedule I narcotic, and they’d be hard pressed to classify it as anything stricter than a Schedule IV. The current DEA hasn’t said much about marijuana but the most recent attempt at Re-Scheduling was met with this response:“Under the DEA's interpretation of the CSA, a drug does not necessarily have to have the same "high potential for abuse" as heroin, for example, to merit placement in Schedule I:[W]hen it comes to a drug that is currently listed in schedule I, if it is **undisputed that such drug has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States** and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and it is further undisputed that **the drug has at least some potential for abuse** sufficient to warrant control under the CSA, the drug must remain in schedule I. In such circumstances, placement of the drug in schedules II through V would conflict with the CSA since such drug would not meet the criterion of "a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States." 21 USC 812(b). (emphasis added)[36]— Drug Enforcement Administration, Notice of denial of petition to reschedule marijuana (2001)TLDR: The DEA says that, in fact, the only thing that “goes into illegality” **is**, in fact, medicinal value. Evidence of which the DEA itself has been staunchly opposed to allowing the existence of. Pot should not be a Schedule I narcotic, and the only reason it is is because the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) made sure you couldn’t easily study Schedule I drugs, thereby trapping anything Scheduled as such in there until someone who’s not willing to just bounce the responsibility of rescheduling between the DEA and Congress like a hot potato.

It's possible that you'll both be found guilty even if she can show that she owned all of the weed. If you knew it was there and you were in the car with it you may have been in constructive possession of it as well.Get an attorney. Follow your attorney's advice.

There is something called the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution which declares that states must follow federal law when a conflict arises between federal law and the laws of any state. The DOJ will likely sue the state in a federal court over the law and use the Supremacy Clause as grounds to have the law overturned. The marijuana laws you a referring to are still illegal under federal law. So the DOJ could sue to have the laws overturned and there could even be federal prosecution of individual violators. So far, the federal government has chosen not to act.

We will agree to disagree then. The reason for the comparison of the two substances is to show while abuse of alcohol can occur, no one thinks ill of having social drinks or beer in a responsible way. The same is with cannabis. You CAN abuse cannabis much the same way as alcohol, to deny any ill effects really doesn't help the movement either. http://stopthedrugwar.org/speakeasy/2010/jul/20/dare_attacks_marijuana_legalizatarticle on it. Overall every one reacts to cannabis differently and the argument for comparing tobacco and alcohol to cannabis is that all 3 substances are harmful yet it should be an adults decision to indulge in those activities.

It’s just anecdotal, but every person I’ve ever known who smoked weed, with only one exception, was someone who smoked it all day every day and was really lazy and had zero interests outside of weed.I do think it should be legal- I think ALL drugs should be legal- but it does seem like most people can’t smoke weed without giving over their whole life to it.

There's definitely merit in 3betting preflop here, but I don't mind the flat call in position with AJo either.On the flop, though, I think we really need to be raising.

We wouldn't need so many prisons if we didn't give people hard time for marijuana-related crimes and petty theft.

Automobile accidents? If you said traffic jams from stoners driving slower it would be more believable. Pot isn't alcohol. While both can impair your ability to drive pot makes people slow down and alcohol makes people speed up.It's probably still not a good idea drive while high, but [traffic fatalities are down in colorado since they legalized.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/08/05/since-marijuana-legalization-highway-fatalities-in-colorado-are-at-near-historic-lows/)

I completely understood the connection you were trying to make, there just wasn't any sense in the connection. And I think you're missing the point, the argument isn't what's immoral, it the law that is immoral. And I don't know about you, but all of my morals are based on facts and my understanding of those facts. So you enjoy marijuana, but think that a law preventing its enjoyment is moral even though you are not bringing any danger to anyone around you. So it stands to reason that if you think the law is moral, the act it prevents must be immoral. So either you didn't think that through or you just have no reasoning skills.

First off, I'm a conservative leaning Libertarian. Putting someone in jail for life for petty offenses is just dumb to me. Life in prison should be reserved for severe offenses, not for someone caught with pot 3 times. (drastic example, but proves a point)

The best part of this is that it makes it impossible for law enforcement to illegally take money and assets in civil forfeiture for cannabis. That’s the real reason police are opposed to ending cannabis prohibition, it reduces their budget. They have spread fear based propaganda to try and stop this from going through and failed!

When I was 14 I got caught with pot (2 joints) outside school. The cop who busted me ended up being good friends with my sister and was really giving me shit about how dumb I was and how easy it was to catch me. He told me my other buddy who knew I had weed got caught cutting class and ratted me out to get out of trouble. He then tells me some of the best advice I've ever heard about keeping secrets and committing crimes. "even though I would have busted you anyway because you were standing in front of school cutting class, always remember it's not a secret if someone else knows."

Yup. I've see it enforced too. It was hilarious.Known dirty player jams short stack, gets called. Board runs out. Dirty player announces straight, other guy snap mucks. Dirty player slams her cards down face up - she had pure air. Dealer says "you can't do that" and slides the pot over to the player that mucked.

Harry J. Anslinger was the guy before the DEA who pushed for prohibition of drugs. Here are some of his quotes."Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men,""There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others."

After 4 years, I quit cold turkey. I realised that I had been taking too many things for granted and if I let it continue, 10 years down the line I would be ashamed of myself for not achieving the things I wanted to when I started law school. Although I got a job as soon as I passed out, I quit it after 6 months because I hated it and I have been studying for exams ever since. But I found that I was failing every exam that I was taking and that made me start doubting myself.I've gone clean for the past 35 days and my struggle with finding a job isn't over yet, but I found that I have a much clearer head now. I can sleep better, now that the nightmares have passed. My motivation is my struggle against myself to bring out the best in me and that can't happen if I get high.I had been getting urges for the past 2 days now and it's been particularly strong today. Seeing another 26 year old guy struggling like myself made me realise that I'm not alone and as I write this my urges keep on diminishing. I won't smoke weed until I achieve my goals and if possible, I'll quit it forever.Stay strong brother.

>FDA has approved two drugs, Marinol and Cesamet, for therapeutic uses in the U.S., which contain active ingredients that are present in botanical marijuana. On May 31, 1985, FDA approved Marinol Capsules, manufactured by Unimed, for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy inpatients that had failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. Marinol Capsules include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, which is considered the psychoactive component of marijuana. On December 22, 1992, FDA approved Marinol Capsules for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. Although FDA approved Cesamet Capsules for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy on December 26, 1985, this product was never marketed in the U.S. Cesamet Capsules contain nabilone as the active ingredient, a synthetic cannabinoid. Nabilone is not naturally occurring and not derived from marijuana, as is THC. [source](http://www.fda.gov/ola/2004/marijuana0401.html)>Claims have been advanced asserting smoked marijuana has a value in treating various medical conditions. Some have argued that herbal marijuana is a safe and effective medication and that it should be made available to people who suffer from a number of ailments upon a doctor's recommendation, even though it is not an approved drug.>Marijuana is listed in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the most restrictive schedule. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which administers the CSA, continues to support that placement and FDA concurred because marijuana met the three criteria for placement in Schedule I under 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(1) (e.g., marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision). Furthermore, there is currently sound evidence that smoked marijuana is harmful. A past evaluation by several Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA), concluded that no sound scientific studies supported medical use of marijuana for treatment in the United States, and no animal or human data supported the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use. There are alternative FDA-approved medications in existence for treatment of many of the proposed uses of smoked marijuana.>FDA is the sole Federal agency that approves drug products as safe and effective for intended indications. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act requires that new drugs be shown to be safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed in this country. FDA's drug approval process requires well-controlled clinical trials that provide the necessary scientific data upon which FDA makes its approval and labeling decisions. If a drug product is to be marketed, disciplined, systematic, scientifically conducted trials are the best means to obtain data to ensure that drug is safe and effective when used as indicated. Efforts that seek to bypass the FDA drug approval process would not serve the interests of public health because they might expose patients to unsafe and ineffective drug products. FDA has not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease indication.>A growing number of states have passed voter referenda (or legislative actions) making smoked marijuana available for a variety of medical conditions upon a doctor's recommendation. These measures are inconsistent with efforts to ensure that medications undergo the rigorous scientific scrutiny of the FDA approval process and are proven safe and effective under the standards of the FD&C Act. Accordingly, FDA, as the federal agency responsible for reviewing the safety and efficacy of drugs, DEA as the federal agency charged with enforcing the CSA, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as the federal coordinator of drug control policy, do not support the use of smoked marijuana for medical purposes. [source](http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01362.html)And since I'm quoting here is 21 U.S.C. sec 812(1) Schedule I. -(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.(B) The drug or other substance has no currently acceptedmedical use in treatment in the United States.(C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug orother substance under medical supervision.(2) Schedule II. -(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently acceptedmedical use in treatment in the United States or a currentlyaccepted medical use with severe restrictions.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severepsychological or physical dependence.(3) Schedule III. -(A) The drug or other substance has a potential for abuse lessthan the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently acceptedmedical use in treatment in the United States.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to moderateor low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.(4) Schedule IV. -(A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuserelative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently acceptedmedical use in treatment in the United States.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limitedphysical dependence or psychological dependence relative to thedrugs or other substances in schedule III.(5) Schedule V. -(A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuserelative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently acceptedmedical use in treatment in the United States.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limitedphysical dependence or psychological dependence relative to thedrugs or other substances in schedule IV.and the spelled marijuana wrong in the law; (10) Marihuana so it not technically illegal in some sense but that probably won't hold up in court.

It’s not the sweldo, but the additional benefits (performance bonus, hmo, recreationals, etc). Most companies offer benefits sa mga workers kapag umabot na sila ng isang taon. Kapag nilagay mo sila sa contract, usually around 6 mos. hindi sila magfofall sa category na yun. Yung ibang hindi nakpagtapos can only get to fast food jobs, kaya importante rin sa kanila ang regularization.

Except you forgot the part where federal law overides state law in every case. So they could be compelled to follow the law. > The law that applies to situations where state and federal laws disagree is called the supremacy clause, which is part of article VI of the Constitution. The supremacy clause contains what's known as the doctrine of pre-emption, which says that the federal government wins in the case of conflicting legislation. Basically, if a federal and state law contradict, then when you're in the state you can follow the state law, but the feds can decide to stop you. When there is a conflict between a state law and federal law, it is the federal law that prevails. For example, if a federal regulation prohibits the use of medical marijuana, but a state regulation allows it, the federal law prevails.

Positive immigration of course being code for NO immigration. Here is the official stance... not many (if any) can afford this...Immigrants must financially support themselves and their dependents for 5 years.

Have you considering taking summer classes? I say this because i took summer classes so that I could either knock out challenging courses over the summer with an A, or I could knock out some easy courses so I focus on the challenging courses during the regular semester. Also, if you have certain courses that are "weed-out / grade-killer" courses, you can try taking them at a community college / different college and transfer them in with no GPA penalty. You'll have to research what can be transferred in, of course.

Why say redneck? That's an unfair generalization. I hate to break it to you but every government has guns and so does every criminal. Gun control is preventing law abiding citizens to own guns. Owning a gun illegally is as easy as buying pot. Whether a gun is used for recreation, combat, self defense, or competition is up to the shooter and person.

I see. It's inaccurate to say he opposes legalization, because he didn't say, "I don't support legalization of marijuana." Fair enough.By the same logic, it is accurate to say that Kennedy does not support legalization of marijuana, because he didn't say, "I support legalization of marijuana."

Fucking fags dude. I gave 2 of my buddies this dudes number (who I and everyone else thought was cool) and he and his boys stole from them too. What the fuck is wrong with people. Low life fucking ass holes. It gets me so heated lol.. But anyways, that's a tough one. I would definitely talk to a lawyer. You would have to say you were selling weed to them, I would think. Especially if it came to court. Wish you the best of luck, sometimes you just gotta let it go which sucks but that is the chance you take from dealing, and it sucks cause some people suck..

Washington, Oregon, Colorado all have an established recreational market. Alaska has just opened its first recreational store. D.C. Allows legal cultivation and consumption for adults over 21, but it is illegal to sell to another person. California is one of the easiest states to get a medical card. Maine, Massachusetts, California, and Nevada voted to legalize recreational cannabis use, but it will likely take several months to a year for recreational dispensaries to open.Edit: Maine hasn't been decided yet?

>McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.>Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm

I knew what you meant, but being high/driving truly only affects the speed of driving. Of course, it's extremely dangerous to drive while drunk or high, and I agree with the law in this case, that driving while intoxicated or under the influence is highly dangerous. However, to be technical, drunk drivers swerve and drive very quickly and erratically. Under the influence of cannabis driving is simply slower and not erratic or fast. Again, driving whilst under the influence of any drug is extremely stupid and reckless.

Sure - and they also dislike when it is legalization of marijuana and the answer is no.You can't enjoy the good parts of a democracy without accepting the bad parts. Just because you think a behaviour should be socially acceptable doesn't mean the majority *must* agree.It is strange to say, but a tolerant person must be tolerant of intolerance. The solution isn't to force opinions on others but to engage in campaigns to change hearts and minds -- something, I might add, the homosexual community has been successfully doing.

> it would have legal recreational marijuana, but not medical marijuanaMy point was that this will never be the case, because recreational marijuana is a *superset* of medical marijuana. Medical marijuana = you have to have a medical reason to buy it.Recreational marijuana = you can buy it for any reason.

So this one time, the cops came to my flat looking for my flatmate because her crazy ex was back in town but she wasn't home so they said they would be back later. So later on I had my mate come over and we were sitting in my room jamming NBA 2K and smoking bongs, we were the only ones home. I heard a knock on my flatmates door and just thought it was one of the flatties or someones mate, our house was pretty open for our mates to come in. I hear a knock on my door and as I'm on a roll on NBA I yell "come in" then the door opened and I looked over and saw the distinctive blue outfits of two police officers and audibly said "FUCK". They ended up taking us to the station and confiscating our weed. The station was quite the experience... "What color are your eyes?.. Ohh red" Got my 6'5" mate to go back to back with the tallest cop on duty. He then asked "Where'd you get the weed?" To which my mate replied "If we tell you, will it get us a free ride home?" He then stared at us blankly and replied "Good thing I vote green" We ended up with just a warning because I don't think it would have stood up in court very well as they just walked into my house and I think they were just bored and having some fun with us on a quiet Monday night.

I think it speaks to kids much more if their parent doesn't make this outright ban. By that I mean, the child is aware that the parent uses cannabis but that it's regulated to age. For bonus points, explain that when children and adolescents use cannabis it affects their learning abilities.Adults are less effected than those with a developing brain.

**Papaver rhoeas**Papaver rhoeas (common names include common poppy, corn poppy, corn rose, field poppy, Flanders poppy or red poppy) is an annual herbaceous species of flowering plant in the poppy family, Papaveraceae. This poppy is notable as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including "corn" and "field") and after World War I as a symbol of dead soldiers.Before the advent of herbicides, P. rhoeas sometimes was abundant in agricultural fields. Although the corn poppy (and its cultivars such as the Shirley poppy) and the California poppy are widely grown in gardens, only Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, has significant farm production.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

> I wonder if an evidence based approach to alcohol might result in another era of prohibition.The exact same reasoning for ending prohibition, like the increase in organized crime, the damage done by unlicensed sellers, the unrestricted sales to minors, are all the same arguments made for ending marijuana prohibition.So no, there would be no return to alcohol prohibition. It was a failure and for the same reasons marijuana prohibition is a failure.

You're confusing the Constitution with federal law. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and it applies to the states and federal government equally. Federal laws are supposed to be based on authority granted to the federal government by the Constitution. The Constitution specifies which powers the feds have and don't have. If they have a certain power then they can make federal laws on the issue and those laws would trump state laws. If they don't then they aren't supposed to be making laws on the issue and it should be left to the states (unless the Constitution prohibits the states from having the power as well). With the marijuana issue, the feds have argued that regulating pot is a power they have under the commerce clause and the Supreme Court has agreed (not everyone else does). Thus, even if a state makes medicinal marijuana legal under state law, federal law still applies.

It's not really decriminalized. You can still get arrested for smoking in public. Even worse, you can get arrested for having "dirty" paraphernalia. Yes, possession of a bag of marijuana will be decriminalized, but if that marijuana is on a bowl, or a pipe (even if you are not smoking it), then you can still be arrested.Also, it would only be decriminalized for the first two offenses. After that, you can get arrested.

One of the problems really is that we expect a perfect operation every raid (or drug bust). It's expecting a war without casualties..... which is sorry to say, impossible. What's sad is that we sometimes put the heavier blame on the wrong people. Take note, "heavier" because they are not the only ones to blame. We dont even just give credit the efforts of stopping the problem with drugs by apprehending (kill or capture) because we are so lazy and pretentious with self righteousness that we always oppose the said killings. (And then you will say e pano kung ikaw mamamatay, gustuhin mo ba?) ... Well the answer is, if ako or kakilala ko or if family member ang naging civillian casualty, then wala akong magagawa diyan. Pwera nalang kung Murder, pero pag accidente lang, then wala talaga tayng magagawa... The least I can do is make sure hindi malalagay sa ganyang sitwasyon by making sure na wala aogn kalokohang ginagawa. Hindi kasi sa atin lang naka ikot ang mundo, isa parte lang tayo dito at hindi natin controlled ang ibang factors. BTW, speaking of change... Honestly, if I ask you this.. Are you willing to adopt a capture addict in hopes na mag bago cya kasi hindi kasya sa mga rehab natin at kailangan ang tulong natin sa ganitong paraan, if not the killing. Hintayin ko po sagot mo ha. :) Excited na ako. I am assuming sasabihin mo na hindi mo responsibilidad yan, pero hindi ba tlaaga kung gusto natin ng change, but Ill wait sa sagot mo. Baka ma surprise ako. Ang mahirap kasi ngayon, illogical na ang marami. Gusto nila ng justice na abiding sa rules (kahit War nah) ... pero yung kalaban, lam natin na hindi talaga susunod sarules, so siyempre diyan palang, lamang na sila. Hindi po tayo overflowing ng police, kaya mas gugustuhin ko talagang lumaban sila kesa mamatay sila dahil sa mga rules of engagement or human rights.

The comparison is being made because the general arguments being made against marijuana are saying that it is in that it is extremely harmful and should therefore be made illegal. When you take alcohol abuse and compare it to what would be considered marijuana abuse. Which one has the worse health risks? So far many studies are showing alcohol does. Yet we allow alcohol to be available for legal purchase, but do not allow marijuana.It's more an argument saying if you allow this, why not this?

>hemp growing is inhibited by legal bullshit thoughNot in every country, and hemp is hardly the only bast fiber or fiber used. The tech used to harvest other bast fibers can and is used on hemp.Many many plants have and can provide fiber for clothing, paper, cordage, nets, fiber filler, etc. Many plant seeds can provide oil, and a lot more oil per acre than hemp seed. Reading about kenaf is like reading about hemp, although kenaf is superior to hemp by some measures. It's legal to grow in the States. Everything that folks claim can be done with hemp is also claimed to be able to do with kenaf, and more. Flax, abaca, ramie, coir, sisal, jute, kenaf, hemp, and several other plants compete alongside each other for the same uses.

I absolutely have to wait several days in between gabapentin doses to get the same floaty, euphoric effects. If I take it two days in a row, nada. Wait like 4 days and take a slightly (only slightly) higher dose, and try that.Benzos don't seem to change my experience of gabapentin much (unless I am legitimately trying to sleep, then it will just help me sleep better), but combining gabapentin with good weed, or once gabapentin with like 12mg of 5-MeO-MiPT, is usually awesome for me.

I don't really get why the OP would think that since weed is legal, these people simply wouldn't exist. I'm pretty sure those people would still be around, they would just find another way to rob people.

The number 1 cause of death related to pot, is MURDER! No one should have to die because of weed. But the Cartel will keep killing as long as it is illegal. If it were legal, cops wouldn't have to die, kids wouldn't have to die, no one should die!

Tis a joke. But it's not that untrue. Immigration, sexual rights, reproductive rights, the right to non monopolized healthcare at a reasonable cost, pot legalization. Gun ownership is a failing with them. Against free speech? Some people are but it's not a requirement. Almost no one is an sjw.

Newsflash: Pot is not legal in NY or NJ and pot is a violation of the NFL rules which means that Aboushi is a fucking moron for getting busted for driving around w/pot in his car. You are too stupid to understand that pot is not healthy for you. Morons like you think that b/c some idiot in the NFL damages his body w/drugs then it must be okay for a schlub like you to do the same. Best of luck w/being a pothead loser.

That isn't what I said, I said that was the original intent of the gun when invented. Killing animals, killing someone trying to kill you, etc. You said the gun is made to fire a projectile, but what is the point of shooting a small piece of metal at near the speed of sound if not to fuck up whatever its hitting? People shooting at targets for fun is a much newer thing, and maybe thats why some people buy guns. But everyone I know who owns a gun owns it for hunting, or self defense (concealed carry, or just home defense). I don't know anyone who owns a gun so they can go to the shooting range and shoot at a target every once and a while. So while you can make the argument "why don't we outlaw cars/pencils/sharp pieces of glass, they can kill people too" it doesn't mean its a legitimate one and there are much better pro gun arguments than that one. This is the equivalent of saying "Well alcohol is legal and its worse for you than weed, so either weed should be legal or alcohol should be illegal".

Also, studies are divided on marijuana's cancer effects. Some studies do suggest that it can inhibit cancer, but some studies also show that smoking marijuana increases the likelihood of cancer by 200% in males. Studies will be clearer now that legality is increasing.

I think he simply meant in terms of its legal designation. Cocaine is schedule II whereas marijuana is schedule I. Schedule I drugs have "no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States", whereas schedule II drugs "have currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, or currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions" (from Wikipedia). Seems crazy to me too, but I'm not from the US.

You can kill someone with your car and get less prison time than a pot smoker. Do they DESERVE a longer sentence? Yes. Are they GETTING a longer sentence? No.

Hit a drive into a pot bunker, take a swing with my lob wedge to get it out. Ball hits the face of the bunker, rebounds, hits me in the chest, hits my club on the way down, and as I'm trying to get out of the way, I lose my balance and ground my club a second or so after. That's a stroke, a stroke for hitting me, a stroke for hitting the club after hitting me, and a two stroke penalty for grounding the club. +5, one swing.

The police still need probable cause to search your car. They can't pull you over for a headlight out and demand to search your car. They would need probable cause. I think the person who you are responding to meant the illegal search and seizure would apply if the cop had no reasonable cause. I don't know the laws where op is, but if the cop claimed he smelt burnt or unburnt marijuana, that would NOT be enough probable cause to justify a warrant less search.

He has to be "under the influence" of any drug to be guilty. (https://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc23152.htm) Having pot in his system, standing alone, is not good enough. DUI is a serious enough crime that you can get a public defender. Show up to your court date and a public defender will be assigned to you.

So I am gonna source my info right at the beginning just so you can have the chance to take a look at it as well. Source: http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm>She wasn't at the drivethrough.According to the source I found she was. Stella Liebeck of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was in the passenger seat of her grandson's car when she was severely burned by McDonalds' coffee in February 1992. Liebeck, 79 at the time, ordered coffee that was served in a styrofoam cup at the drivethrough window of a local McDonalds.>which is why her attorneys never argued that the coffee was 190 degrees, but that it was 180 degrees, and in 12-15 seconds she received 3rd degree burns.While you have stated that you disagree with these times this is what was argued by the Plantiff: The Plaintiffs' expert, a scholar in thermodynamics applied to human skin burns, testified that liquids, at 180 degrees, will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds.>Almost literally no one serves their coffee cooler than 160*.Post-verdict investigation found that the temperature of coffee at the local Albuquerque McDonalds had dropped to 158 degrees fahrenheit.It is also important to note that McDonald's was aware of the risks with serving their coffee at such a higher temperature. During discovery, McDonalds produced documents showing more than 700 claims by people burned by its coffee between 1982 and 1992. Some claims involved third-degree burns substantially similar to Liebecks. This history documented McDonalds' knowledge about the extent and nature of this hazard.McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.

I've heard of people having really terrible, scary trips on spice. The "fake weed" stuff you can buy legally. It either makes you trip massive balls, or nothing at all. Sounds very similar to something I heard from Someone who did spice. Their trip was that they were in hell...so yea

I think that once its legalized for the entire country (how ever long that is) the "recreational" in recreational marijuana will start to fade off, the only reason we use it at the moment is because we need to differentiate between medical and recreational, once it doesn't matter to be medical or not it will change

The problem isn't capitalism its self. The problem is crony capitalism. When the government has its hand in the pot and is receiving money in order to create legislation, protect the corporations interests and essentially purchase politicians that serve the corporations we have a big problem. Everyone blames capitalism, but we don't have capitalism in the US we have corporatism.

In my old high school you used to be able to leave class and go to the bathroom when ever you wanted, if you decided not to go back to class, the teacher would tell the principal office and they would ding you up so you get a detention, well sooner or later pot heads decided to hot box every bathroom, so the entire school was restricted to only using the bathrooms during the 7 minutes in between classes and it was chaos.

> How could you have any sort of functional society if your rights could be taken away by the whim of some dictator or a vote of society?For an example I will point out.... every society that ever existed or ever will exist. How long do you think you would live if society decided you have no right to life? Your right is absolutely dependent on the collective will of society. Mosquitoes do not have that right, because we have not granted it to them. Domesticated animals have a shadow of that right, because we have chosen to give it to them.> I take it you don't believe in any sort of natural rights.I don't even know what natural rights are, and I wager you don't either.> Why do we need to agree on them as a society? Why is what the majority thinks the best/right thing to do? History shows time and time again the great flaw in this line of thinking...Outside of culture the idea of a best or right action has no meaning. There is no objective standard we can point to. I can agree with you that the certain laws of certain societies were flawed and not the best or right thing to do without claiming that my opinion is based on an objective standard that doesn't exist. The people in the societies you spoke of were likely just as sure as you are that their ideas of right and wrong were objective truth. That is the danger of pretending to knowledge we don't have. Do you doubt that people in some societies would see your economic ideas as barbaric? Society improves through open dialog and the exchanging of ideas.> I believe only what I can rationalize for myself.I have not seen you rationalize anything. What is the rationalization for natural rights, and how did you select the rights to go in that category. You claimed that we should not allow them to be dictated by monarchs or determined by society, yet you turned to the founding fathers as your only support.> But if society (or dictator, or whoever), dictated that these in fact were not rights, would you accept that and move on?No, I would not. I have my own ideas of right and wrong, and I would continue to advocate for them if I were able. Rejecting an objective standard does not mean that I don't think some ways of doing things work better than others. I believe for various reasons that smoking pot ought to be legal, and I will advocate for that. But for today we don't have that right because society has withheld it. (The details of why I believe it should be legal would take us off course, but I would be happy to discuss it in a different thread if you wish. For this discussion the important thing is that I base it on subjective values that are almost universally held.)> As I've expressed above, I do believe in natural rights.You are continuing to make self-referential arguments. Where do natural rights come from? If you have no answer to this then we have no basis for discussion. Are you a theist who believes they are sent from God? Then I have no answer without entering a discussion of theology. I would be more than willing, but do not want to launch off topic if this is not the case. Do you think there is some other origin? Then tell me what it is and we can discuss it. But I don't know how to respond to the idea that natural rights must exist because without them we would have no natural rights.> Could you elaborate more on where you think rights come from?I don't think I can improve much on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/i3n3j/are_beliefs_a_choice/c21aarx) post I made in another discussion. (At least not without more time than I have ATM.)I believe rights come from those in power because I see no other place for them to come from. That doesn't mean I don't wish it were otherwise. But I also know that pretending an objective authority exists when it does not will cause intellectual and moral stagnation. We can't get better if we don't change, and we can't change if we pretend our current point of view represents objective truth. I guess we can't get worse either, but I don't want to live in fear and denial.

Recently they are looking into abolishing death penalty and medical marijuana, while here our ministers are still talking about how weed has zero medicinal effect and his deadly, and how if you repeal the death penalty society will collapse.

> If you're a smart swain then at level 1 you abuse your e and aa harass, like one or two aa's so you don't aggro so muchFizz can just sacrifice level 1 last hits in order to avoid this. Also I always start with Flask + 3 pot on Fizz so I can afford to drop a few, most Swain players start with Doran's + 2 pot which makes taking a bit of early damage fine>at this point you wait till 6 for fizz to have a chance to fight swain in which he probably has the advantage in a straight fightFizz without a doubt can all-in Swain before 6. Do poor trades early, force him out of pots, keep yourself up with your superior sustain and boom, free kills. At level 5 you'll simply do too much damage for Swain to live. He will have to burn flash and in most cases you can follow him with yours and get the kill..Also Swain is going to need to spend all of his gold to not die to Fizz's all in, in which case Swain doesn't do enough damage to push Fizz out of lane.On top of this Fizz can easily waveclear with his E where as Swain is going to take a bit more time to kill creeps so Fizz can easily and safely roam since Swain is stuck to being mid. If he decides to follow you, he'll lose CS and you'll still get ahead.Annie's damage early on isn't enough to compete Fizz, it's almost guaranteed that Fizz can kill Annie at level 3-4. Even if Annie uses W first to get the stun.I've got some 200+ Annie games played since I started, I know my Annie. Also Tibbers has a cast animation, a good Fizz player can dodge it. Also almost all Annie players telegraph their plans on going all-in so good Fizz players can read that and punish it.These match ups aren't absolutely unwinnable for Swain or Annie, but they heavily favor Fizz, and if they're players of equal skill level Fizz should come on top at least 80% of the time.In an ideal world the things you are pointing out would work easily against Fizz, but the thing is, Fizz doesn't need to play aggressively in these match ups, he can play reactively. He can only ever cast E when he needs to, he doesn't need to go in with it.That's the big thing here. Fizz has the freedom of farming it out, and punish the enemies when they try to do something to him. He can win any match up by waiting for the enemy to strike first. Well, except Pantheon..

If you plead to the PDP in jail, you have ten days to submit a motion for a new trial. Then you can request a deferral program, or you can plead not guilty and go to trial. You can likewise attempt to participate in a pretrial diversion program for the marijuana. Ask your lawyer. If you do not have a lawyer and cannot afford one, request a lawyer at your next court date. You will not be appointed a lawyer for the PDP, though.

I agree that the number of possession cases is only going to increase in the foreseeable future, and I also agree that the court system is very overburdened.However, if marijuana defendants know they have a solid chance at a nullification, they will begin to opt for jury trials. Remember, it is the defendants, not the prosecutors or courts, that decide what goes to trial and what doesn't.

You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As we say in Texas. I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselfs in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell? Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you ckoke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll.Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.the only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of your of whay you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

As a 25 year old who is moving back in with his parents 3 years after graduating, this hit home for me. I, too, have been smoking quite a bit of weed and I genuinely believe it's helping to shape me in many positive ways. Moving to knock out as much of my loans as possible while taking as good of a job as I can to figure out what's next. It's tough to trust myself in doing this, but I keep telling myself this move is a smart one that will permit me to get where I want to (soon as I figure that out) a bit faster. Realizing that what I really want is comfort and fulfillment, and finding someone to share that with. I'll get there. Thanks for sharing.

Yup this is the great advice, I also always look for the all in at lvl 3 because with all his abilities, the empowered w and the ign almost always gaurentees a kill or summoner spell. The hard part is getting to lvl 3 in good shape. Just try to not get poked alot early on, starting corrupting pot first helps with this. I usually start e in most matchups to be safe, against melee you could start with w as it makes it easier to cs and trade, it also has less of a cooldown than e which has a super long cooldown early so don't waste it. Lvl 6 is also a great all in as well especially if your opponent is lvl 5 still. As for items I usually build corrupting into dark seal into revolver. I usually finish protobelt then go for Sheen and lich bane next. Zhonya is usually my third item. Hope this helps, good luck with him and hope he's not banned a lot.

Actually, if it was legalized, I bet processing companies would start up, and marijuana cigarettes would start popping up, so you could buy them by the pack, pre-rolled. The Govt would tax by the pack too, probably the same amount as cigarettes, if not more.Then you have other industries like pipes, bongs, vaporizers, etc, which would really take off.

The last marijuana arrest I made was a pretty good story. I was sitting up on a stop sign late at night. I saw a car roll through the stop sign. When I went to stop him, he took off running. It was a short chase before he cracked up into a ditch. He, of course, took off running. Straight to his house. And straight into his bedroom. Which is where I caught up with him. And tackled him right next to a 50 pound bale of marijuana.To this day I can't figure out why he led me directly to it.

Companies retain their right to terminate (or not hire) anyone who pops on a drug test, including weed. There is no law stating applicants or employees cannot be fired or disqualified for having marijuana show up on a drug test. Having said that, it's easy enough to take a few weeks off while looking for a new job, and as long as you don't mess up in your job – as in, enough to make them give you a drug test – you're golden.

If I can get the same quality stuff delivered for cheaper, why would I go to a store to buy it myself? Dealers aren't going anywhere, they're just going to have to work harder to be more competitive. I'm not buying into this nonsense about being sold dangerous or low quality pot from dealers just because the government didn't grow it. There's always been high quality pot, and now I'll be able to get it cheaper than I did before legalization.

I was arrested and even had the bag it was in, considered "paraphanelia". So I ended up getting a paraphanelia possession along with the marijuana posession charge itself, although usually one or the other is usually dropped in court. It seems now though people will just get hit with paraphenlia posession charges and simply have the bud confiscated instead, to still be criminally charged.

>State law demands that only businesses who are already licensed for medical marijuana sales and are in "good standing" with the state can apply for a recreational license. Postlethwait said that there is a pool of roughly 550 medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado that can apply for recreational sales licenses.[Source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/worlds-first-recreational_n_4317190.html)It must have been a medical marijuana business beginning December 12 of last year.The specific wording of the law is:>Medical Marijuana Business Applying for a Retail Marijuana Establishment License. A Medical Marijuana Business in good standing or who had a pending application as of December 10, 2012 that has not yet been denied, and who has paid all applicable fees may apply for a Retail Marijuana Establishment license in accordance with the Retail Code and these rules on or after October 1, 2013. A Medical Marijuana Business meeting these conditions may apply to convert a Medical Marijuana Business license to a Retail Marijuana Establishment license or may apply for a single Retail Marijuana Establishment of the requisite class of license in the Medical Marijuana Code for each Medical Marijuana Business License not converted.

To get the same level of insurance that banks do, credit unions are backed by the National Credit Union Administration, which was created by congress and must follow federal banking laws. The refusal from banks to deal in the marijuana industry is because doing so risks losing NCUA or FDIC insurance. The other option is to create a private bank or credit union, with independent insurance.

That's prison. Jail is where they put you when they arrest you but aren't going to put you in prison. People *imprisoned* while awaiting trial are in *prisons*, which are not the same facilities as *jails*.If someone is put onto *jail* over marijuana, I consider that someone being "locked up" over marijuana. And that number is well over a million people, in America, based on arrest numbers alone.

I've never tried it, never really felt the need. I hang around a lot of people who smoke on a regular basis, though, and it doesn't bother me at all. I'm all for legalization and all that. I just don't really think weed would enhance my life at all so I've stayed away from it so far.

Decriminalized != Legalized. Less than 100 grams is a $150 fine. "Typically, decriminalization means no arrest, prison time, or criminal record for the first-time possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal consumption. In most decriminalized states, these offenses are treated like a minor traffic violation."http://norml.org/aboutmarijuana/item/states-that-have-decriminalized

Namely to be measurable. But also to demonstrate that it's morality, rather than just some random law of physics.That is, in order for morality to *be* morality, there must be some judgement. Whether that be subjective (done by person to person) or objective (some static reference deciding moral things).When it's subjective, there's naturally no 'punishment' that happens if you do something 'bad'. Only the holder of the view could punish you (and if they had the power, they would). This is the legal system. Illegal is "bad" and you are punished. In this sense it's a subjective moral system. Nothing *actually* happens to you when you break the law. People smoke weed all the time and are fine, yet it's against the law.An objective system, on the other hand, necessarily needs to inflict this. Otherwise there's no way to demonstrate it exists. Or that it should be called morality.If something you do inflicts something, that doesn't mean it's morally good/bad. Is eating Vitamin A good morally? No. There's no reward, morally speaking, for this. It simply makes a biological change in your body. There's no objective measure as to whether this is a good or bad thing. The objectivity is that it made a change.As such, I wouldn't call digestion "objective morality". An objective morality would necessarily need to inflict it's decisions on moral rulings.Once you subjectively pick a set of rules, you may then objectively judge them. But the act of picking something as morality is a subjective act in itself. Objective morality would need to make this judgement obvious, and something that clearly defines *itself* as morality. Otherwise it's the same as not existing.

Definitely interesting and a good move but I wouldn't expect an instantaneous change with banks. They will need to change their own internal policies and develop standards for doing business with legal marijuana businesses. Also, they will need to decide if it is worth the risk of doing business with them.I work in KYC compliance for the private banking business line of a large financial institution and there are certain types of business (ex. casinos) that they are prohibited from opening accounts for because the risk that comes with them is just not worth the money they'd bring.

Mormons are not Christians. No matter how mainstream they become, or how much they use their deep pockets to aggressively market themselves as Christians, they are fundamentally not Christian. Beliefs are important, and just because you accept and believe in the divinity of Jesus does not make you a Christian. After all, Muslims too accept much of the Jesus story, and included in the Qu'ran are stories from the life of Jesus. In fact, you can't be a Muslim without believing in Jesus.Now, even though Muslims believe in Jesus, and accept almost the whole of the Jesus story, no one would argue that they are Christians. This is because there are fundamental differences in belief, and there are certain things a group must believe, or reject, in order that they may be called Christian, Muslim, etc...The beliefs of the Mormon faith do not match up with that of Christianity. Yes, they believe in the resurrection, and the divinity of Christ, but that is not enough to be considered "Christian," especially when they hold a number of other beliefs, that in no way a part of, or present in, Christianity.The best analogy I can come up with off the top of my head is to say, calling Mormonism, "Christian," is akin to calling someone who believes in heavy government regulation and taxation of business, and legalization of marijuana, Libertarian. Yes, they've got one part of being a Libertarian down (keeping government out of what legal adults choose to put into their bodies), but their other beliefs (heavy regulations and taxation of business) so far disqualify them from being a Libertaraian that the term is not apt.

Yes, that's why marijuana should be used *responsibly* just like alcohol should. Minors should not use it. Regardless, when you compare the two, alcohol is far more harmful. It's not even a contest.Yet, alcohol is perfectly legal.

From the [actual initiative text](http://www.unitedforcare.org/ballot_language_1): > “Caregiver” means a person who is at least twenty-one (21) years old who has agreed to assist with a qualifying patient's medical use of marijuana and has qualified for and obtained a caregiver identification card issued by the Department. The Department may limit the number of qualifying patients a caregiver may assist at one time and the number of caregivers that a qualifying patient may have at one time. Caregivers are prohibited from consuming marijuana obtained for medical use by the qualifying patient.

Yes, use VRs in parallel to get all your voltages, but if you are starting with 9v, you can't use a voltage regulator to get 9v. There is a minimum loss of about 1.2v. So you'll have to just use the 9v you're starting with, or start with at least 10.5v to regulate it down to 9v. The 5v is easy, a 7805.7v will be tougher, but an LM317 will work using the correct ratio of resistors in the "adj" pin of the VR. Just google "lm317 7 volts" or something like that, or use a 240 ohm resistor from adj to out, and a 5k trim pot from adj to ground to dial in your 7 volts. It'll end up at 1.1k. Vout = 1.25(1+(R2/R1)) where R2 is adj to ground and R1 is adj to out. I set R1 to 240 so the math says R2 will be 1104 ohms. Use whatever values you wish as long as R2/R1 = 4.6. You can actually do the same thing with the 5v, just make R2/R1 = 3[Schematic.](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/articles/reg3.gif)[Formula.](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/articles/reg4.gif)

Thank you for asking for further explanation.Lets take the taxonomy question first: ragweed declaring to the world that it is a rose.The early Friends began, as one person has described it, as a colony of heaven in a Christ denying world. Their foremost distinguishing characteristic was experiencing Christ Jesus within and among them in all his offices or functions. They experienced Christ within and among them as their prophet and teacher to teach them the Father's will and to empower them to accomplish that will. They experienced Christ as their priest who washed them in His life, cleansing them from dead works that they might serve the living God. They experienced Christ to be their king to rule in their hearts by faith. This was Emmanuel, God with us, and their government was upon His shoulders. They knew Christ to be their shepherd who led them into the pastures of life and made them drink from the waters of life. Christ was their counsellor who counselled them in all things. They experienced Christ to be the living fire and hammer to beat down and burn up all that was contrary to God in thought, word, and deed. Thus Edward Burrough could write in his introduction to Vol. III of Fox's Works: "And we found this light to be a sufficient teacher, to lead us to Christ, from whence this light came, and thereby it gave us to receive Christ, and to witness him to dwell in us; and through it the new covenant we came to enter into, to be made heirs of life and salvation. And in all things we found the light which we were enlightened withal, (which is Christ,) to be alone and only sufficient to bring to life and eternal salvation; and that all who did own the light in them which Christ hath enlightened every man withal, they needed no man to teach them, but the Lord was their teacher, by his light in their own consciences, and they received the holy anointing. And so we ceased from the teachings of all men, and their words, and their worships, and their temples, and all their baptisms and churches..." (For the full text, see [Burrough's Introduction](https://thiswasthetruelight.wordpress.com/edward_burrough_intro).) They lived in a society that made profession of Christ but denied Him to rule over them, to teach them, to cleanse them, to counsel them, to feed them, etc.These are the "field marks" of that people of God in scorn called Quakers.Today, those who would claim descent, and thus ownership of the same taxanomical designation, do not share these field marks. The current field marks declare that we are dealing with something entirely different; something bearing no relation to what began in the 17th century.Now, the question of human frailty.When John the Baptist saw Jesus walking, he proclaimed, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world." The sin that the Lamb of God takes away is death within where God expects to see life. Humanity was created in the image of God, living beings. But when we choose to listen to teachers other than God, we lose the image and we lose the life. This is the human frailty I am referring to. This death, this turning from Emmanuel, is the root of all evil, and humanity remains a prisoner of death until they come to hear and follow the voice of Christ.Here the early Quakers stand out as an example without peer since Apostolic Christianity. They gave living demonstration of the power of Christ to gather a people unto himself; a people made alive and brought into unity by hearing Christ's voice. Where Christ and His government are repudiated, either in word or deed, there is no hope of overcoming evil, no hope of being made alive. There is nothing left but human frailty.

I agree. I think it should be legal because I think that there is no significant difference in the potential harmfulness of cannabis compared to nicotine and/or alcohol. It can certainly be harmful, but it is something that an adult should be able to make a decision on themselves.

>if you're going to prison multiple times ya, maybe you should just try and not go to prison. It isn't hard. For a multiple offender I have no problem with giving them a longer term every time.

Um, yes there is a mis-communication, the mis-communication is on your part.The current situation has marijuana legislation in place. Marijuana legislation is simply laws regarding marijuana, such as bans and regulations. Obama supports this legislation. Anyone that opposes marijuana legislation is someone that is in favor of legalizing marijuana. "Opposing marijuana legislation" and "opposing marijuana legalization" are very similar (though not identical).Obama is in favor of marijuana legislation, this is the current situation in which marijuana is legislated.So now that you understand that people that oppose marijuana **legislation** are people that want less laws regarding marijuana, do you still think that Obama opposes marijuana **legislation**?

I think people view investing in penny stocks that are ultimately in a legal grey area (weed is still a scheduled 1 substance!) are considered gamblers. High risk with high reward.Anyone believing in the long term success of any penny stock, let alone a weed stock should take a step back and reevaluate ones logic.Will these stocks bubble around media hype (legalization, state revenues, etc)? Ofcourse.Will these all these weed stocks be around for 2-3+ years? I dunno. I am bullish about this sector, but I want everyone to remember what they are investing in: Speculation. And more times than not, speculating doesn't work out. No matter how good a penny stock is, it is still a penny stock.

Personally for the withdrawals I used kratom and phenibut to mitigate the withdrawals during the day (I would cycle between the two) and then for sleep issues I would smoke weed or I would take Valerian root, melatonin, 5-HTP, or kava. At times I would take phenibut to help me sleep. Depending on where you live if it's legal then I'd suggest that you try weed to help with the sleep issues as weed is easily one of the best sleep aids out there as long as you get a nice indica strain. But of course check your local laws on this. If you don't want to go the weed route then I'd still suggest using kratom, or phenibut during the day. Be careful with phenibut however as tolerance builds very quickly and dependence can easily develop, although as long as you keep the dosing frequency of phenibut limited to 2-3 times a week and never back to back you'll be fine. Also if you're going to try phenibut remember that the law of diminishing returns is definitely strong with phenibut, I'd never suggest going over 1-1.5g at the most per day as any dose above that I've found to become much more recreational then anything else. Kava is a great alternative to my weed suggestion if local laws prevent you from getting weed, but if you go the kava route please do good research into how to prepare it properly to ensure your liver doesn't get damaged if you're going to use it on a consistent basis to help with sleep. With 5-HTP for me personally I found it worked well; however I didn't find it to be beneficial enough on its own to help me with sleep, so I would mix it with kava, phenibut or Valerian root to help my sleep, if I wasn't using weed to help. Anyways I hope this helps and feel free to message me or reply here if you have any questions.

If you are playing in a lane where you know you have the advantage. Like you got an early kill, have a fort pot running, or just have the better matchup it tends to be a good idea to sit in the caster minions to harass or fight your lane opponent if they try to get close enough for last hits or even experience. It's very aggressive and can get you punished with a gank if you aren't careful, so ward well. Sometimes if the lane is pushed towards me and sit past the casters and miss out on a few last hits just to deny my opponent experience on top of last hits. Top lane(probably my second most played role) champions that tend to do this exceptionally well are Darius, Riven, Teemo, Nidalee, Akali -- pretty much any champ that, when they have the advantage, can just stomp all over their opponent.

Less power? Perhaps. But there *are* other non-drug crimes and other drugs to sell, and the cartels will not be out of business. They *will* focus on other things. What they won't do is just magically disappear because of an end to marijuana prohibition (and I'm for ending the prohibition). I just don't expect the violence from Mexican cartels to stop when marijuana is no longer a lucrative commodity to them.

[source](http://www.dsmattorneys.com/criminalprocess.html)>The general rule is that warrants are required for searches. However, search warrants are not required for the following:>Search Incident to Arrest. Police officers are permitted to search your body and/or clothing for weapons or other contraband when making a valid arrest.>Automobile Searches. If you are arrested in a vehicle, the police may search the inside of the vehicle. To perform a complete search of the vehicle (such as in locked glove compartments, for example), probable cause is necessary.For police to search a car without a search warrant, they have to place you under arrest first. This usually only applies for people who have been caught drunk driving. A police officer smells marijuana. He cannot make an arrest because he smells the weed. If he cannot arrest you, he cannot search your car without a warrant. edit: formatting

It's not just about him not being able to get things done, it's about him not even trying or actively working against those campaign promises: Health care reform - worked against the public option behind the scenes.Financial reform - hired all wall street insiders to key positions, and no prosecutions.Warrantless wiretapping - promised to filibuster it, then voted for it.Closing guantanamo/ending military tribunals - barely even tried.Not prosecuting medical pot - the raids continue to this day.Fuck anything Obama says now.

The US is the front dominoe. Right now, they essentially pressure every country to not pass legalization under the guise of enacting trade sanctions against the countries that do. It serves the best American interest for us to get our entire marijuana infrastructure in place before we legalize so that when all the dominoes do fall, we'll be at the top of the heap.

> "I've got an addictive personality. So to me a drug is a drug, no matter if it is alcohol, marijuana or cocaine. It is all addictive. So if some people got an addictive personality, well they're going to get addicted."She explains this away herself. The problem is her, not cannabis. People can become addicted to anything. That's no reason to stop legalization. That's a reason for her to seek help.

I don't know if it is because of the dealer, but I do agree that our laws make it a gateway drug. Kids are told how much illegal drugs will screw up your life. Then they try weed, and it doesn't screw up their life. If they were told weed was so evil when it was fine, why would they believe meth is as bad as they were told?

No one is saying alcohol should be illegal. By making alcohol legal and marijuana illegal they have set a standard for what people are capable of using and not abusing and what should be allowed for consumption and what shouldn't. However Alcohol is leagues worse than marijuana and so if that is the bar they have set than marijuana surely should be legal as well.

If they going to hike the price above what people paying now on the street, people will still buy from the dealers rather than from LCBO. Unlike alcohol, where you cant illegally sell for constant profit, due to size of product, weed doesnt require large storage areas for turning profits. If they want to sell it and not just to keep it on shelves for display they will have to sell it for less than street value.

Sorry to hear about your difficulty with the doctors in the pockets of big pharma. I am not sure of what part of Canada you are in, or the laws , but a simple Google search of medical marijuana doctors Canada will result in doctors who would be more understanding and able to write you a recommendation. I also know the NORML website has a list of local doctors. I hope you get relief and I think that especially with stomach issues herbs are the way to go, I had some issues and I saw a really great ayurvedic (indian) doctor who had me take a whole bunch of herbs that gave me greater relief than I'd had in many years.

Will they access legal cannabis or will they continue to access black market cannabis just as they do today? They don’t access black market alcohol because there is no black market alcohol. It will be far easier to access black market than legal, the government just ensured a huge market remains open to the black market.

**Acid foods** - Foods which contain enough acid to result in a pH of 4.6 or lower. Includes all fruits except figs; most tomatoes; fermented and pickled vegetables; relishes; and jams, jellies, and marmalades. Acid foods may be processed in boiling water.**Altitude** - The vertical elevation of a location above sea level.**Ascorbic acid** - The chemical name for vitamin C. Lemon juice contains large quantities of ascorbic acid and is commonly used to prevent browning of peeled, light-colored fruits and vegetables.**Bacteria** - A large group of one-celled microorganisms widely distributed in nature. See microorganism.**Blancher** - A 6 to 8 quart lidded pot designed with a fitted perforated basket to hold food in boiling water, or with a fitted rack to steam foods. Useful for loosening skins on fruits to be peeled, or for heating foods to be hot packed.**Boiling-water canner** - A large standard-sized lidded kettle with jar rack, designed for heat-processing 7 quarts or 8 to 9 pints in boiling water.**Botulism** - An illness caused by eating toxin produced by growth of Clostridium botulinum bacteria in moist, low-acid food, containing less than 2 percent oxygen, and stored between 40 degrees and 120 degrees F. Proper heat processing destroys this bacterium in canned food. Freezer temperatures inhibit its growth in frozen food. Low moisture controls its growth in dried food. High oxygen controls its growth in fresh foods.**Canning** - A method of preserving food in air-tight vacuum-sealed containers and heat processing sufficiently to enable storing the food at normal-home temperatures.**Canning salt** - Also called pickling salt. It is regular table salt without the anticaking or iodine additives.**Chutney** is a spiced condiment of Indian origin (chatni is the Hindi word for strongly spiced) made of fruit or vegetables. It is typically served as an accompaniment to food, not as a spread. The spice level can range from mild to hot, and the consistency from a fine relish to a preserve or conserve. Fruit chutney consists of chopped fruit, vinegar, spices and sugar cooked into a chunky sweet-tart-spicy mix: according to one explanation, it blurs the Western distinction between preserves and pickles.**Citric acid** - A form of acid that can be added to canned foods. It increases the acidity of low-acid foods and may improve the flavor and color.**Cold pack** - Canning procedure in which jars are filled with raw food. "Raw pack" is the preferred term for describing this practice. "Cold pack" is often used incorrectly to refer to foods that are open-kettle canned or jars that are heat-processed in boiling water.**Conserve** is a mixture of more than one fruit, often with added nuts and raisins, that is cooked until it becomes thick. It is used as a spread for breads, pastries and meats, and in the latter use is closest to chutney.**Enzymes** - Proteins in food which accelerate many flavor, color, texture, and nutritional changes, especially when food is cut, sliced, crushed, bruised, and exposed to air. Proper blanching or hot-packing practices destroy enzymes and improve food quality.**Exhausting** - Removal of air from within and around food and from jars and canners. Blanching exhausts air from live food tissues. Exhausting or venting of pressure canners is necessary to prevent a risk of botulism in low-acid canned foods.**Fermentation** - Changes in food caused by intentional growth of bacteria, yeast, or mold. Native bacteria ferment natural sugars to lactic acid, a major flavoring and preservative in sauerkraut and in naturally fermented dills. Alcohol, vinegar, and some dairy products are also fermented foods.**Fruit Butter**, such as apple butter or prune butter, is fruit puree or pulp combined with sugar, lemon juice and spices, slowly cooked down to a smooth consistency. The "butter" refers to its spreadability: there is no actual butter in the product.**Fruit Curd** is a creamy spread made with sugar, eggs and butter, generally flavored with citrus juice and zest.**Fruit Spread** is generally a reduced-calorie product made with fruit juice concentrate and low-calorie sweeteners replacing all or part of the sugar.**Headspace** - The unfilled space above food or liquid in jars. Allows for food expansion as jars are heated, and for forming vacuums as jars cool.**Heat processing** - Treatment of jars with sufficient heat to enable storing food at normal home temperatures.**Hermetic seal** - An absolutely airtight container seal which prevents reentry of air or microorganisms into packaged foods.**Hot pack** - Heating of raw food in boiling water or steam and filling it hot into jars.**Jam** is made from crushed or chopped fruit cooked with sugar, and often pectin and lemon juice. Jam can be a puree of fruit or have a soft pulp, but it does not contain chunks of fruit.**Jelly** is a clear, bright product. It is generally made by cooking fruit juice and sugar with pectin as a jelling agent and lemon juice as an acid to maintain a consistent texture. Jelly is firm and will hold its shape (it shakes). Generally, jelly contains no pieces of fruit, although specialty jellies, like pepper jelly, may include pieces of jalapeno or other pepper.***Low-acid foods** - Foods which contain very little acid and have a pH above 4.6. The acidity in these foods is insufficient to prevent the growth of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Vegetables, some tomatoes, figs, all meats, fish, seafoods, and some dairy foods are low acid. To control all risks of botulism, jars of these foods must be (1) heat processed in a pressure canner, or (2) acidified to a pH of 4.6 or lower before processing in boiling water.**Marmalade** is a soft jelly, often citrus-based, that includes both the flesh and peel of the fruit suspended throughout the jelly base. The bitterness of the peel offsets the sweetness of the jelly.**Microorganisms** - Independent organisms of microscopic size, including bacteria, yeast, and mold. When alive in a suitable environment, they grow rapidly and may divide or reproduce every 10 to 30 minutes. Therefore, they reach high populations very quickly. Undesirable microorganisms cause disease and food spoilage. Microorganisms are sometimes intentionally added to ferment foods, make antibiotics, and for other reasons.**Mold** - A fungus-type microorganism whose growth on food is usually visible and colorful. Molds may grow on many foods, including acid foods like jams and jellies and canned fruits. Recommended heat processing and sealing practices prevent their growth on these foods.**Mycotoxins** - Toxins produced by the growth of some molds on foods.**Open - Kettle canning** A non-recommended canning method. Food is supposedly adequately heat processed in a covered kettle, and then filled hot and sealed in sterile jars. Foods canned this way have low vacuums or too much air, which permits rapid loss of quality in foods. Moreover these foods often spoil because they become recontaminated while the jars are being filled.**Pasteurization** - Heating of a specific food enough to destroy the most heat-resistant pathogenic or disease-causing microorganism known to be associated with that food.**pH** - A measure of acidity or alkalinity. Values range from 0 to 14. A food is neutral when its pH is 7.0: lower values are increasingly more acidic; higher values are increasingly more alkaline.**Pickling** - The practice of adding enough vinegar or lemon juice to a low-acid food to lower its pH to 4.6 or lower. Properly pickled foods may be safely heat processed in boiling water.**Preserves** are fruit cooked with sugar to the point where large chunks of fruit or whole fruit, such as berries, are suspended in a syrup base. The texture of preserves is not smooth like jelly or jam.**Pressure canner** - A specifically designed metal kettle with a lockable lid used for heat processing low-acid food. These canners have jar racks, one or more safety devices, systems for exhausting air, and a way to measure or control pressure. Canners with 20- to 21-quart capacity are common. The minimum volume of canner that can be used is 16-quart capacity, which will contain 7 quart jars. Use of pressure saucepans with less than 16-quart capacities is not recommended.**Raw pack** - The practice of filling jars with raw, unheated food. Acceptable for canning low-acid foods, but allows more rapid quality losses in acid foods heat processed in boiling water.**Spice bag** - A closeable fabric bag used to extract spice flavors in a pickling solution.**Style of pack** - Form of canned food, such as whole, sliced, piece, juice, or sauce. The term may also be used to reveal whether food is filled raw or hot into jars.**Vacuum** - The state of negative pressure. Reflects how thoroughly air is removed from within a jar of processed food--the higher the vacuum, the less air left in the jar.**Water Bath Canner** is a water bath canner is a very, very large pot, with dimensions to hold at least 7 quart jars and allow them to be submerged by 1 to 2 inches of water. The canners usually include a rack with handles to make it easier (and safer) to put the jars in and take them out of the boiling water. Most boiling water canners are made of aluminum or porcelain-covered steel. **Yeasts** - A group of microorganisms which reproduce by budding. They are used in fermenting some foods and in leavening breads.

Currently some medical programs are basically a cover for legalized cannabis. That problem should (hopefully) go away soon with full recreational legalization. Who gets to choose what are "legitimate medical uses"? There are many people with many different illnesses, diseases, conditions, and disorders that respond amazingly well with cannabis treatment.Cannabis is not like other medications. There is nothing else like cannabis around. Yeah lots of people use it to get high, and lots of people use it to help treat conditions they have, and many use it as both. If a condition, such as let's say depression or anxiety, responds well to cannabis usage, how is that not a proper medicinal use? The part where they are "just getting high" is the part that legitimately helps them.

Haha, yeah sorry, not convinced. The studies you link only briefly address the subject (like literally one sentence in each that's relevant) and one doesn't even show citation for the claim. While another cites a source that I searched through and found only one mention of the word "sativa" and no evidence to back your claims. Bottom line is there is far from definitive evidence of your claims. Come back when you've got a comprehensive study addresses this specific issue.

Spice, I'm not much of a weed smoker, but back in 2010 it was legal and sold in the local smoke shops so I figured, why not....never again. I started panicking, and my heart started beating so damn fast that I thought it would explode, which made the panic worse, which in turn made my heart beat even faster. It was fucking terrifying. I ended up going outside in the middle of the night in the dead of winter and standing barefoot in the snow to get myself to calm down. After a couple minutes my heart slowed down and the panic subsided, good lord that was a horrible experience.

I can tell you, from experience, when I used to smoke weed, I rarely drank. It was mostly when I wanted to try a craft beer or if I didn't have any weed. Now I don't smoke and I drink more often, because I can't smoke! I don't have an alcohol problem, but I definitely noticed an increase in drinking when I stopped smoking.Also, the only time my friends ever drove high (I never did it, always too paranoid) was when they wanted to get high somewhere discreet, then go home/to the movies/to a diner, whatever. If it was legal to smoke, people won't travel to get high, because they won't worry about being caught! That's just my opinion though...

1) Please explain how I am a bigot. I mean that sincerely.2) A God who is human (and, moreover, one who preaches repentance and mercy rather than justice and is *nailed to a cross*) is, on the face of it, as different from the God of the OT (or, perhaps, the God of Judaism) as two deities can be. Jesus radically altered the perception (and the reality) of God's role in people's lives. God became a particular individual - Jesus Christ (who, moreover, is never depicted so much as swatting a fly, in contrast to the violence of the OT). I don't see how that is "the same God." The religion changed entirely. To say it's "the same God" is to completely discount the competing theologies, soteriologies, and ideologies of Judaism and Christianity. At this point, you can just say that any two religions that *have a God* have the *same God*, because you don't accept any distinctions whatsoever.3) I don't say Mormonism isn't Christianity just because I think their theology is crazy. I say they're not Christians because they reject the fundamental teachings of the universal Christian Church: for one, they believe that human beings and God (and Christ, who is not "God" as we understand Him) are of one nature, meaning that all men can become God(s) with time. There is no difference between Creator (they don't have a "Creator," as they believe all matter existed eternally). They also reject the Trinitarian formula (one indivisible God in three completely distinct Persons, with a shared nature, will, and action) that *literally defines* Christianity. They even proclaim a "Great Apostasy," intentionally cutting themselves off from the entire early Christian Church after the Ascension. Nabbing the Bible as your Holy Book does not make you a Christian, no more than smoking marijuana makes you a Rastafarian.

(Live in an illegal state, also had anxiety and depression) Find a dealer you can trust. Be careful of where and when you use. Be careful not to do too much too quickly.In my experience, weed helped with the depression, but not the anxiety. The first time I tried it, I literally described the feeling as the opposite of depression. The paranoia factor did not help my anxiety, though. I think it affects everyone a little differently, so try it little by little and know yourself. You don't want to become "addicted". No, it's not physically addictive, but at one point I felt like I needed it to not feel depressed.Again, it's different for everyone, so take my experiences with a grain of salt. Good luck and I hope you start feeling better!

Probably nothing to worry about unless they've turned it into a major grow house. :D Aside from that, have you looked into holding the house in a trust or corporate entity, rather than as a personal asset subject *to your personal legal issues? All depends on your situation, but if it's substantial money, might be worth looking into.

It's a $150,000,000 proposal. Colorado has made over $1,000,000,000 in legal weed sales. The proposal could double its cost and I don't think Colorado wouldn't even feel it.

I don't think you understand how minimum wage works in this country. You may be basing your assumptions off how the service industry works in the states? In the UK everyone gets minimum wage, including service staff. It's the law. If tip income goes into the salary pot then so be it. But if there where no tips then the staff would be paid minimum wage regardless so no they are not being paid £5/hour.

> Effects on the LungsNumerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;[8](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16128224) however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.[9](http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/15/10/1829.abstract) Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.Quote source: [http://drugabuse.gov/infofacts/marijuana.html](http://drugabuse.gov/infofacts/marijuana.html).

I lose a lot of matchups when the enemy player has better damage foresight than me. I'll start a trade, and instead of running away the enemy will trade back aggressively. Because of my low HP/5, they can usually come out ahead with corrupting pot. I don't think Riven is an early game monster. After first back she gets stronger, and eventually she becomes crazy good, but if she can't chunk you early game, then you can punish her squishiness and poor regen. That's my two cents. I'd be down to practice 1v1s with you and try and workshop some openings.

Both parties (defense and prosecution) have to agree on the jurors selected for the trial. Otherwise, a hung jury can occur (which is a mistrial in the states). If one of the jury's members thinks pot smokers should get the death penalty, or in contrast, a juror sympathizes with the defendant because they deal drugs, a verdict may not be rendered or a fair trial with unbiased jurors may not occur.

I remember when Obama said "he'd put on his walking shoes and protest with them" when referring to union strikes over restriction of their rights, I remember when he said he would negotiate and end the foreign wars, I remember when he was for universal healthcare, then a public option, and then finally the 1995 Republican healthcare plan. I remember when he said he wouldn't continue the Bush tax cuts. I remember when he said transparency and protection of whistleblowers would be a cornerstone of his presidency.I remember when he said he would stop the DOJ and DEA from raiding medical marijuana dispensaries in states that have voted to allow them. I remember when he said he wouldn't reauthorize the patriot act. I remember when he said he would close Guantanamo. I remember when he said he'd end the wars only to move troops out of Iraq because negotiations to keep them there with extraterritorial rights failed.I remember when Obama wasn't Bush the third.

this doesn't matter. by joining the military you serve the military complex and do your job on helping other to kill people.Just have a look what american soldiers do in afgahnistan, iraq and so on. Have they yet found some weapons of mass destruction in iraq? By joining the forces YOU are a part of americas killing/exploiting in the world (suppose you are american).When you join, YOU are a part of the forces that torture [people.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse)And then you can be proud to fight the glorious war on [Terror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_War_on_Terror).You can then invade iran, syria and all the other oil countrys. Please reconsider your decision. I'd rather live in aworld where everyone smokes pot, than i a world where everyone joins the army. What do you think?

And if there is anything the state needs, its desperate drug addicts. They are the safest people around, and don't cause any crime. Edit - I think people are missing my point - taking state aid away from people that need it makes them desperate. People who are addicted to drugs (obviously we are not talking pot here) are going to want to feed their addiction, but now they don't have money at all. They are more likely to turn to crime now.

Honestly, you may feel like that for a couple of days. I usually get a loss of appetite and maybe my mood is a bit different (curves my anxiety a bit), but you just get used it and after 3 days its kind of just normal. I love the quick sleep I get from cannabis, but I find if I stop, my sleep cycle is like it was before my use.Honestly man, just go for it, its your life and you have to prioritize and value things that really needs to be done for the long term, that is what is important. Pick up a hobby or fill your time with other things you enjoy and eventually its all good.Also it is not surprising that people feel different after discontinuing use. We have to remember that cannabis is a drug that alters our state of mind and that's the reason we enjoy it. And if you're doing it often, then you're going to feel different in some ways when you stop. Especially when it regulates things like appetite and gives you a relaxed feeling. Its all about adjusting and its absolutely possible.

> Maybe some people can drive while high - most people can't. Those who are not confident driving stoned probably shouldn't. But that doesn't mean that many, many people can drive high safely. I'm not saying that those who are unsure about their safety while driving high should just go ahead and try it-- far from it. If you don't think it's safe, DON'T DO IT. But for those who are confident in their driving abilities while stoned (those who *do* choose to drive high), and don't believe they're a danger to themselves or others-- plenty of academic evidence exists that supports their position: "There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance" - *University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales* "THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs (Robbe, 1994; Robbe and O'Hanlon, 1995; O'Hanlon et al., 1995)" - *University of Limburg, Netherlands* "There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected" - *University of Adelaide, South Australia* "marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident" - *University of Toronto, Canada* "In two studies with reasonable numbers of individuals who had only used cannabis, there was no clear evidence of increased culpability in these drivers." - *The Lancet* "No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis" - *Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute* "Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving" - *Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs* "The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08" - *U.S. Department of Transportation Study* "[Cannabis'] effect on higher cognitive functions, for example divided attention tasks associated with driving, appear not to be as critical [as with alcohol]. Drivers under the influence of cannabis seem aware that they are impaired, and attempt to compensate for this impairment by reducing the difficulty of the driving task, for example by driving more slowly." - *"The Influence of Cannabis on Driving," Prepared for Road Safety Division, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, UK, by Transport Research Laboratory, Ltd.*

I would argue that Worshipping Jesus is self degrading. Jesus taught that one should accept a lowly position in life with grace. Jesus taught that the meek and mild will inherit the earth. Jesus taught you to conform, to not ask questions, to accept oppression. In many respects, Christianity is the religion of the weak! The elite ruling classes of history loved Christianity. It keeps people satisfied with their position in life, and distracts them from socioeconomic oppression. Satanism on the other hand, is empowering. Satan sought his own moral code, independent from God. Satan offers a paradise to the nonconformist. Satan doesn't promise everlasting life. He promises a short, but well lived, hedonistic, powerful, independent life here on earth. Satan offers that which is tangible.Jesus says you must be obedient, so you can get high in heaven. I'd rather smoke pot here on earth with my buddy Satan, thankyouverymuch

I love how they seem to think legislation of marijuana means "bus drivers, forklift operators, hospital technicians, crossing guards who might be stoned could be coming to your community".

I don't think its better to cut first. Increasing revenue first would be the better I think. Revenue increase is not just about increasing tax rates. While government revenue is mostly taxes there are other factors that affect how much is collected. If the economy is doing well and businesses are growing there is more revenue in taxes then if the economy is in a recession. Government action which increases the economy whether through top down (which I think is crap) or down up could increase revenue more then what it costs. Simply "cutting" is not the first solution. The first solution is to try and get them off the programs if possible (which is what many on the right consider government waste). Whether through legislation or incentives getting people off without just changing the qualifications for these programs would reduce their costs. Then see if its possible to reduce the need for certain programs or agencies. An example is legalizing pot which costs the government billions in enforcing the ban on pot would reduce costs a little. Once you go through that I think it would be better to start cutting waste (which while some thing of as waste others need it for jobs) and increasing revenue through increasing tax rates.

I´m not sure what you are doing with the extra resistors. Just use the LM317 with fixed resistors(two of them) and maybe a pot to adjust it if you need the precision. If you use a 1k and 1.6k resistor it should net you 3.25V out, no matter what load. You don´t need to take the current into account unless it is more than the LM317 can handle, and then you would have other problems. For the second voltage you need, just add another regulator with the appropriate resistors. The IC will sink/source the current needed if you provide it with the right voltage. If you apply 3.3V and then a resistor, you will be limiting the current the IC can draw and with high probability introduce problems.

> When I say subjective I mean:> "based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions."> Now, I find Kantian "subjective morality" to be a very rational position. There is nothing stopping you from learning from other people's subjective experience/morals/reality/ideas.No, you do not actually embrace Kantian subjective morality, because Kantian subjective morality is hard-as-nails absolute and is absolutely not "based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions." It is based on what Kant calls "Ideas of Pure Reason" which are the same for everyone and allow no exceptions.> In fact, it's much easier to consider someone else's truth if you embrace the fact that truth is subjective!No you do not really consider anyone else's ideas because to really consider them would mean you'd be considering whether they are really true or not.>> So, wouldn't this criticism would have to apply equally to all moral ideas because they would all be equally 'subjective'?> I would argue that trying to apply morals on a universal basis is not only foolish but impossible.That did not answer the question, but it again shows that you do not actually consider Kantian morality.>> If so, then you are indeed saying we can offer no specific criticism for why any specific moral idea is wrong apart from that general debunking of all moral ideas as subjective and therefore arbitrary.> I am saying that any criticism MUST be specificBut the only criticism you have offered so far is general, and it logically excludes any other criticism from being justifiable.> due to the fact that reality is subjective.You keep using the word "fact". Is this idea that "reality is subjective" an objective or universal fact? Or is it itself only a subjective opinion of your own?> Either wrong is simply a feeling we all have inside us, which would make it subjective, or it's something we learn, which is also subjective.Most people would distinguish between a thing actually being wrong and a thing merely feeling wrong, or in other words between appearance and reality.> Then I don't know if we'll ever agree. Much like Plato and Aristotle.Neither Plato nor Aristotle took moral relativism seriously.>> "Holds within themselves" as what?> I'm not sure what you are asking here. Do you not understand that my personal values might differ from the consensus morals?Are these personal values "held within yourself" as being ***true***?> If you need an example, smoking marijuana. Does the fact that the majority of people think it's an immoral act make it immoral?Certainly not. Does the fact that you happen to think it's a moral act make it moral?> If you believe these things are objective and universal, I'd assume you do?Then you'd assume wrong. Only if moral realism is true is it possible for there to be a mismatch between the real morality and the morality of a particular society. If there's no difference between what people think about morality and what's really true about morality then people (including societies) can never be incorrect about morality. By defending moral realism, I am defending the idea that it is possible for society to be incorrect about morality.>> Are you saying this makes objective morality bad?> I am saying that it cannot exist.If this is a conclusion which you're trying to support from the premise of homosexual behavior being a sin having been caused by believing in 'objective morality' then this argument is a non-sequitur, meaning your conclusion does not follow logically from your premise.I use the term "moral realism" because that term includes Kant. Kant's universal necessary absolutism treats morality as being real, not opinion-based and non-arbitrary despite being"subjectivist" -- which means that Kant is using a sense of the term "subjective" that has very little relation to how ordinary people use it. Another advantage of the term "moral realism" is that "moral objectivism" in meta-ethics is easily confused with Ayn Rand's Objectivism in ethics, so I think the term "moral realism" expresses what ordinary people want to express by "objective morality" much better without these ambiguities. I use other terms such as "objective morality" when you use them, merely to help you keep the thread of the conversation, but "moral realism" is what I'd really be defending.Moral realism is true, and believing in the truth is good, therefore believing in moral realism is good.> I am saying it makes it subjective. Good and bad are subjective values.I see. Earlier you said 'objective morality' was bad. I hope you see now that without some standard of values which is more than just opinion, you have no grounds to criticize 'objective morality' as being 'bad' or to praise 'subjective morality' as being 'good' since we have no common standard of 'good' and 'bad' beyond what you describe as our private personal likes and dislikes on which to base our arguments.You say that what you call 'objective morality' caused the Holocaust, prohibition and "homosexuality being a sin". You said this in order to try to persuade me that 'objective morality' is a bad thing because it has caused bad things and that which causes bad things is also bad. But that is logically dependent on the premise that these things you say were caused by 'objective morality' actually are bad. Your argument doesn't work if, in my personal subjective opinion, all of those things are neutral or even good. There is no common standard you could appeal to as actually being true which could justify your judgement that any of those things are bad. I certainly couldn't have any justified grounds to change my opinion of any of those things based on hearing your opinion of them.And it works the same with your contention that "The idea that morals/ideas/reality are subjective leads us to discovering things such as evolution and science." You say this in order to show that 'subjective morality' is good, because it caused discovering evolution and science, discovering evolution and science is a good thing and that which causes good things is also good. But that is logically dependent on the premise that discovering evolution and science actually is a good thing. Your argument doesn't work if, in my personal subjective opinion, discovering evolution and science is neutral or even bad. There is no common standard you could appeal to as actually being true which could justify your judgement that discovering evolution and science is good. I certainly couldn't have any justified grounds to change my opinion of the value of evolution and science based on hearing your opinion of them."Real Natural Philosophers (there are some now alive) will perceive that in defending value I defend inter alia the value of knowledge, which must die like every other when its roots in the Tao are cut." -- C. S. Lewis> Only the Sith deal in absolutes.The word "only" is itself expressing an absolute.' "Only X do Y" is an absolute because it applies universally "for all X" and admits of no exceptions.> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.About the physical world, Socrates was an idealist like you. I disagree with Socrates there and agree with the sophists. But when it comes to morals/ethics (the main thing Socrates was concerned with) Socrates was a moral realist like me. You disagree with Socrates there and agree with the sophists.> Are you saying this makes objective morality bad?I am saying that the purpose of moral philosophy is to understand what's right and what's wrong, not to prevent people from doing bad. Other things, like a religious upbringing, would serve much better in that department.> I can't handle all these value statements in a debate whether reality is subjective. What point are you trying to make by asking subjective questions? Whether I think it is good or bad, is entirely subjective!I was pointing out that you were relying on various judgements of things you brought up as being good or bad as a premise for your argument while holding a philosophy that excludes any conceivable way of ever justifying any of your premises.> I wouldn't like to be murdered.Why should I care? That's just your own personal preference. It doesn't tell us why you shouldn't be murdered."I wouldn't like to be murdered"? My response would be, "I like strawberry yogart."> I don't see it like that.Doesn't matter, because it actually is like that logically.> You seem to have this idea that people cannot be influenced and that minds cannot be changed.No, just this idea that there is a difference between a justified argument and an unjustified one.> As if it being subjective means it cannot ever be wrong.That's exactly what my argument shows it does mean. I can never come to a realization that I am wrong about my own opinions, because if I did then they would no longer be my own opinions. I can never be wrong about them because they are my own. But I can be wrong about realities outside my own opinions. Someone could construct a argument that my opinions don't match reality, and this could justify a change. But if there is no reality other than my own opinions then while I could change my mind, (as moral anti-realists tend to do anytime they feel like doing a bad thing) such a change could never be justified logically.> When that's exactly what I think when you say something is objective.Saying that moral realism is true does not in any way necessitate that my own opinions about right and wrong actually do match what the true opinions are. Quite the opposite in fact: to say that moral realism is true means that my own opinions might not match! It means that I might be wrong, because there is something apart from my own personal opinions for them to be wrong **about**.> It's all or nothing right?Only if there are some answers is it possible for there to be some answers which I don't know.

One thing to consider is that your current limiting circuit is *before* your voltage regulator, so when it kicks in, it will reduce the input voltage to the regulator in order to try and maintain the desired current. At some point, the voltage regulator's input/output voltage differential will go below the working minimum so regulation will go to pot and, of course, if the regulator's input voltage drops too far, you'll get no output. You might consider moving the current limiting circuit to after the voltage regulator.Also, bear in mind, that the voltage regulator will be burning off its input/output differential voltage * max current so what's the rectified DC voltage? Say it's 34V because you used a 24V transformer (rectified voltage is 1.414 * AC RMS voltage), then the regulator will be burning off around 10 * 5A = 50W... The data sheet for the 338K says that its case temperature rises 35C/W, so in free air, the device's temp will be ambient + 1750C ....um, I expect the 338 will have shut down well before then!So: Check the regulator's DC input voltage and make sure it's only a few volts above the output voltage + it will need a heatsink.In general, for the power output required, a switching power supply would be better as they are more efficient (waste less energy as heat), although they are not the best choice if the load requires a low-noise PSU (eg: an audio amplifier or some kind of test/measuring gear)

Yeah. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't read it either."The neonates of heavy-marijuana-using mothers had better scores on autonomic stability, quality of alertness, irritability, and self-regulation and were judged to be more rewarding for caregivers. "They try to suggest other factors give these results - "suggest that the better scores of exposed neonates at 1 month are traceable to the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal development"This means either the effect of Marijuana on unborn children has positive effects or NO negative effects or negative effects so negligible, social-economic factors can overcome them and make them positive.

Well for starters, I am not anti-pot. But any responsible parent wouldn't want to encourage their children to knowingly break the law. As far as I know, there isn't a state that allows for recreational pot usage for those under 21. Doesn't make any sense to have a young high schooler or early young adult have their parent "allow" for this whitewashing of the law. Instead maybe it's better to have age appropriate events occur when the child/young adult actually reaches the age to be able to responsibly handle these new experiences and challenges. From the OP's own answers, one of the sons dropped out of school, and now the sons are joining with the Father to withhold the truth from the Mother. It's only come to light now that the youngest child has somehow come forward to tell. Seems to me there is more than one problem brewing with this family.Since when is it ok to have children adult or otherwise working one parent to get over on the other parent? It's ok when weed is involved? What lesson is that teaching for the future of these kids? You can lie to your Mom about weed, after all it's only weed????I get it, any whiff of disapproval for using recreational weed (apparently no matter the age) is met with a slew of down votes, but come on! It does not seem from the OP's post that these high schoolers nor the Father is handling it very well.

No, that's completely different then someone driving drunk and killing someone or someone driving high and getting in a car crash.

A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselfs in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you ckoke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.the only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of your of whay you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

There was an FBI report awhile back that the average marijuana arrest cost $7500. Looking for that link! What I am trying to do is get that source. $7500 even sounds low. So what is your guess of how much an 'average cost per arrest" is? Police, booking, etc. One year of jail time cost NYC $167,000 per prisoner, so an arrest cost of $7500 seems way low.Source: Taxpayer cost of housing NYC prisoners last year: $167,000 per inmatehttp://nypost.com/2013/08/23/taxpayer-cost-of-housing-nyc-prisoners-last-year-167000-per-inmate/

"Any illicit" would include cannabis and ecstasy. I assume that those are the two most often used drugs. You would have to look at the Hibbel citation to see what drugs are included.In all instances, drug use climbed after decriminalization, 1999-2003. But then in 2003-2007, drug use dropped considerably. There is still more drug use than in 1999, but the harder drugs that were causing the problem, like ecstasy, have dropped more than cannabis.

There was no prohibition on cannabis, this is true, it is a purely western idea that cannabis is evil. However in the context I was replying to, the use of any intoxicants to get closer to God is frowned upon everywhere since the tradition began, however while the inhibition continues in Tamil tradition, it has become popularly accepted in the North.Even among the Nath sampradhaya where cannabis use is common, the Naths who don't smoke to reach advanced meditative states are highly respected.

I agree with your first point. Which has zero to do with your second. Your argument was you're against legalization of marijuana due to the lack of studies regarding the long term health effects. But you indicated you're also not in support of prohibition, yet there are plenty of studies available that show the long term effects of that drug. So why are you only concerned with marijuana? Your argument is inconsistent.

The court can look to what the religion is and what the beliefs are without determining whether those beliefs "make sense." They don't have to be willfully ignorant about the religion itself. They can, as it were, "look on the box." They would say, "Oh, this is a fake religion created to mock real religions. We can't believe that you believe in a religion that explicitly holds itself out as not a religion, sorry.">Look at mainstream religion. Most believe that a woman was impregnated by an invisible deity amongst many other crazy (to me) beliefs.But they *actually believe it*. That's the point. The pastafarian explicitly *doesn't* believe it or believe in *any* other religious belief. That's the *point* of the non-religion. Christianity exists to uphold the belief that Mary actually gave birth to Jesus as savior of the world. Pastafarianism exists to undermine religion itself, and there are no *actual* beliefs of the "religion." The "religion" is just a tool; belief in its tenets are never real. Whether one is "crazier" than the other is absolutely irrelevant to the analysis. The sincerity is what's at issue. One cannot "sincerely" have "religious belief" in a non-religion.>You mention the smoking marijuana religion. The Rastafari believe Ganja to be a spiritual purifier. Christian churches serve wine to minors as they believe it to be the blood of christ, a spiritual purification ritual. Both are considered valid religions.The Rastafari did not create their religion so that they could avoid laws prohibiting marijuana use like my hypothetical "religion" did. Christians did not create their religions to usurp drinking age laws either. Both groups created their religions because they believed in the transcendent truths of their religions. The law is and always was incidental. They are completely unlike my example (or pastafarianism).

While I think that argument could have the most social impact, I think the most powerful case against prohibition is the fact that marijuana is far less harmful to society than tobacco and alcohol, which we already regulate. We have decided as a society already that despite their dangers, "adults" can purchase and consume tobacco and alcohol legally, and face legal consequences for it (mostly alcohol here, drunk driving, etc). Why not so with marijuana?

Yeah I agree, but I still wouldn't call marijuana prohibition a success, Id just say that alcohol prohibition was a bigger failure than marijuana prohibition is, marijuana prohibition is still a complete failure in my opinion.

This is the recipe I use. My in-laws are Indian and my husband says this is as good as his Mum's :) Ingredients1 cup red lentils uncooked1tsp salt½ tsp turmeric1 tbsp olive oil 1-2 tbsp butter or ghee (optional)½ tsp cumin seeds1 onion chopped finely1 tsp finely chopped fresh ginger4-5 pieces of fresh coriander, separate stems from leaves. Finely chop stems, roughly chop leaves.½ tsp chili½ tsp garam marsala1 tomato roughly choppedMethodWash the red dahl to remove as much starch as possible.In a medium pot, boil the lentils with the salt and turmeric until the lentils are transparent and soft. Set aside.In a separate pan, heat the oil and add the cumin seeds. They need to brown and will sizzle and become fragrant, be careful to not have them burn.Add the chopped onion about 15-20 seconds after the cumin. It’s important to add these quickly as the onions in the pan will assist in making sure the cumin seeds don’t burn.Brown the onion on high heat.Add the chopped ginger and coriander stems and continue to brown. You can add a little butter here to glaze the onion and add more flavor. The onion will be very brown by this stage, caramelized but not burnt. It’s very important to have it browned as this is a lot of the flavour.Add the chopped tomato and cook until the tomato is mushy and soft and taken on a brown colour. If you need to push the tomato to soften it you can.Add ½ tsp chili powder and ½ tsp garam marsala and cook through. At this point you can add water to this pan if the water level in the lentils is low due to boiling off. 1 or 2 cups is enough, but the consistency is up to you. Bring to the boil and add to the pot with the pre-cooked dahl.Boil the Dahl pot again to infuse the flavours from the marsala and the lentils. Add the chopped coriander leaves at this point and salt to taste.edit - "lentils" missing ty /u/kapntoad

This election cycle is actually the only time I could maybe imagine a hypothetical third party candidate being viable if it ends up being Hillary vs Trump with Sanders running as an independent. You're right though, the two part system is a sham. I'm pro choice, pro gun, pro marijuana legalization and there is no party for me. Only having two viable options forces way too many people into being single issue voters.

> driving while high is just as dangerous as drunk driving.I'm not trying to say driving while high is ok, but this is not even remotely true. The effects of the two are completely different, and driving drunk is far more dangerous than driving high. Most studies I've seen concluded that driving high is similarly risky to driving slightly under the legal limit for BAC. Basically if you took a few swigs of beer but were still under the legal limit and tried to drive, that's more or less what driving high is like. Again, not saying that's ok, not at all, just saying that drunk driving is WAY scarier.http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/24/politics/marijuana-study-drivers-impact/http://now.uiowa.edu/2015/06/ui-studies-impact-marijuana-drivinghttp://www.attn.com/stories/891/effects-of-marijuana-on-driving

Who would guess waiting to legalize marijuana and taxing it, stop the war on drugs to reduce police and prison spending, taxing buisnesses more but not require them to provide healthcare because the new tax would pay for it, spending more on education to let more people enter higher education so they get better jobs and pay more taxes, reducing military spending by pulling out of useless wars, putting more money into welfare to create a base that can help people find more sustainability sooner so they can start paying taxes again, and other common sense programs could actually create a surplus!

Grapes aren't nearly as profitable as cannabis. You can grow indoors in any climate, and I'm sure some people would rather sell on darknet markets than to dispensaries because it's more profitable. Maybe you're right, and nobody will take advantage of legalization to make money. But I think a lot of people will.

It wasn't 'pretty hot', it was 180F, more than 40F the regular temperature.>During discovery, McDonalds produced documents showing more than 700 claims by people burned by its coffee between 1982 and 1992. Some claims involved third-degree burns substantially similar to Liebecks. This history documented McDonalds' knowledge about the extent and nature of this hazard.>McDonalds also said during discovery that, **based on a consultant's advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees**.> Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat.> The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.

I was just using pot as an example because it was brought up before as an actual incident. You start running into issues when the suspect leaves their home if you don't have a warrant. If you don't have a warrant, you can't get in unless they let you in and give consent to a search. The issue here is you need two warrants: An arrest warrant and a search and seizure warrant. If you have the search and seizure, you can arrest them after you find evidence. Getting an arrest warrant without evidence is trickier and takes longer.

I would like to point out that you are never obligated to consent to any search by law enforcement, unless it is on a traffic stop and the Officer has probable cause for a search. The Officer can only perform a pat down for weapons, but needs a search warrant to search your person or belongings. I am assuming the Officer asked to search your backpack and you said "yes". Otherwise, it was an illegal search and seizure. If it went to trial you could suppress the contraband as evidence because it was illegally seized. So many people do not know their rights under the constitution. Unless the Officer has a warrant, you can say "I do not consent to any searches." On traffic stops, if an Officers smells an odor of marijuana, he can conduct a search of the vehicle without your consent. Any other time, they MUST have a search warrant!!

Well, first, when I say something is a "matter of conscience", I'm talking about my personal feelings on the matter/ how *I* would handle the situation if I was placed in it. My personal conscience carries absolutely zero weight with anyone else, the same way I personally wouldn't care what someone else's "conscience" said I should do about a situation involving me.Would it bother me if someone I knew had "bailout" abortions and didn't learn from the experience/change their behavior to prevent it from happening again? Yeah. It probably would. Depending on how extreme the circumstances, it could even reach a point where I decided I no longer wanted to associate with that person. But that being said, regardless of how I might personally feel about their choice, ultimately I believe that it is their choice to make, and unless they specifically asked me for my opinion about it, I probably wouldn't say a word.Secondly, there are other options in the case of an unwanted pregnancy. I have a very close female friend who, due to bad choices she made in her teens, had a child at 17 that she put up for adoption because she was not in a position to be able to care for it. Had she asked my opinion at the time (this was long before we ever met), I would have told her that I agreed with her choice and felt that it was the best thing she could have done in that situation. But ultimately, it's HER choice. How I "feel" about it shouldn't come into play.I'd say my stance on abortion is similar to someone who doesn't personally smoke weed, but is in favor of legalization. Just because it's not something they would choose to do to their body doesn't necessarily mean that they think the government should force everyone to make that same choice.

The thing is for me, I get that many people want weed to be legal, and you shouldn't go to jail for weed I get it; I also think you have the right to fight to make weed illegal, if you really cared that much. The thing for me is the girl could've completely avoided the situation by just not having weed. Even though it's "just weed" she still doing something thats illegal at this point and time.

Did you not read the sentence (you know the one you partially quoted) where I explicitly exempted legal purchases? Also I have no idea how you think the majority of pot smokers buy from legal sources. Quite the majority of pot smokers don't travel to where it is legal.

juvenile delinquent, kicked out of every high school attended. Went to alternative, private, boarding, military schools, christian school..got my GED and got into local college. Had a kid before graduating hs and got a girl pregnant and also (unrelated) put on felony probation for 5 years. Spent about a year total jail time, broken up into about 7-8 different occasions. Somehow got into State uni a couple years after messing around in comm college. Started getting an accounting degree and spent more time growing weed and working random jobs, never actually put anything into school. Loans basically up and I get to a point where the gig is up: my gpa drops too low and I'm kicked out of the business school. I took a couple semesters off and thought about things. Almost got a degree in public policy, which I'm glad I backed out of last minute.I thought long and hard one day and ultimately decided I would choose something worthwhile to me and just go all in and if I was going to go out it would be trying my best. I was done trying to pretend I had everything together without any struggle, and decided to give myself completely to something. I chose Computer science. Every semester since I've crammed up to 16 hours/semester and spending hours upon hours studying. 2 semesters left and I have all A's/B's in all math/computer science courses. I've learned so much over the last almost 2 years and I am so glad I made this decision. I'm no longer worried about my/daughter's future. I'm learning, I'm growing, I'm developing (albeit a little late in the game) from a delinquent into a very capable computer scientist. I don't even know what I want to do ultimately, I just know that I'm going to succeed because this is now my life and I love what I am becoming considering where I have come from. tl;dr - juvenile delinquent-turned-computer scientist grad(2 semesters left), total 180 degrees in life. one day just decided to do something worthwhile and try my hardest at it and it has been working out.

It could be a result of the chemicals you used. Typically it isn't always advised to use a harsh chemical in a potted plant. When you water, water deeply until the water is running out of the bottom of the pot. This will help remove any left over chemicals in the soil. Try to let it dry out in between watering. Also if weather permits, leave tree outside.

Not sure what your local herbicide by-laws are but I would hose the place down with a herbicide to kill everything prior to cultivating it. You will still have tonnes of weed seeds in the soil waiting to germinate. Once you seed it with grass seed you will need to wait a bit to get it established(selective broadleaf herbicides can kill new grass) then you will need to do another application. It's a bit of a process but it can be done. will you be irrigating this new lawn area?also do a little research into drought tolerant grass seed varieties, you set yourself up better for success with hardier drought tolerant varieties of grass.

The US has [state laws and federal laws](https://www.lawhelp.org/resource/the-differences-between-federal-state-and-loc). Federal laws apply to all states while state laws are exactly that- laws of a state. If a state law is in place that gives citizens more rights, it is supposed to be the prevailing law; however, this does not mean that a state law is allowed to supersede a federal law. In [Article VI](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi) of the Constitution, there is something known as the [supremacy clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) that includes the doctrine of pre-emption. The doctrine of pre-emption essentially means that if there is conflicting legislation, the federal law will trump the state law. In other words, if you are in a state, you can follow the state law, but the federal government has the right to stop you. Let's say that marijuana is illegal on a federal scale, but your state has legalized it. The federal law holds greater jurisdiction and supersedes the state law. If Roe v. Wade is appealed, states can legalize abortion, but the federal law still prevails.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. The weed experience I described weren't just a "high". It was a full blown panic attack. I could hear my heart really loud in my ears while I couldn't make out any sentences people were saying. I myself at that time thought I was just too high so I didn't really "panic" I had a fun time. It was till later I figured out about depersonilization and panic attacks etc. So how extreme is a panic attack induced depersonilization? Will it still go away by time..

He plans to pay for free college with a .5% tax on Wall Street transactions, which actually should leave a surplus. His plan to fund paid family leave is through a .2% payroll tax increase. His plan to pay for healthcare is a little more complex. It would require an across the board tax increase on everyone, but the tax increase would be less than what you are currently paying for healthcare, as it would save about $400 billion in administration fees. His infrastructure plan hasn't had a funding plan released yet, but, if we look at the tax revenue from states that have legalized marijuana, it would more than likely give us more money than his infrastructure plan would cost, and his infrastructure plan would also create 5 million jobs, which would stimulate the economy. His college plan also creates a better educated work force, which will stimulate the economy.

It's close to equivalent to lock up the murderer and 1 innocent person, then to let both free and have 1 innocent person die.But what if the reoffending rate is lower than 100%?Or what if the crime isn't murder, but selling weed? Then you're suddenly comparing someone selling weed to having an innocent person locked up. Theft? Then you're locking up an innocent person to prevent someone from stealing? Is that an equivalent trade?

The party voted [in favor of legalization](http://bc.ctvnews.ca/federal-liberals-endorse-marijuana-legalization-1.754350), at our last convention. Since then, Rae has made a big deal out of it. Unless the leader vetoes the policy, it is going to be part of our platform during the next election. Considering a majority of Canadians support our position, I would say that is unlikely.

Not taking a side, but many consider that since we have allowed marijuana to continue being illegal it creates the black market for it. As such, these incidents happen when if it was a regulated market it would legitimize the business and remove such crimes.

When you smoke cannabis, cannabinoids travel throughout your body and bind to your CB1 and CB2 receptors. Over time, your receptors will down-regulate, meaning the quantity of receptors will decrease. This is what causes tolerance.No matter what strain of cannabis you're smoking, the cannabinoids will target the exact same receptors. Switching between strains shouldn't lower your tolerance at all.

I think that would be pot heads. Or just anyone who doesn't think you should go to jail for smoking pot. Decriminalization and legalization are not the same, but it's safe to assume a candidate who supports Decriminalization will support legalization as well.

Up to 25 grams: New York has decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana (at least as far as first and second violations are involved). Violations are considered civil citations (similar to a traffic violation), which incur a fine, but no jail time. There is a fine of up to $100 for a first offense, and up to $200 for a second offense.

It might be that this is the first time marijuana was legalized for recreational use as opposed for medical purposes like it was before while gay marriage has been legal in some states for a while. I personally think gay marriage is more important but I think people are more excited about marijuana because this is a first time moment for recreational marijuana.

> I thought Federal law trumps all?Kind of? So the Federal Constitution trumps all, and in it there is the Supremacy Clause: > This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be *made in pursuance thereof;* and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. [emphasis added]What that means is that federal law does trump state and local laws if, and only if, they are made in pursuance of the constitution. In other words, there is an argument to be made that, for example, federal laws regulating intra-state activities (those that do not involve interactions with anyone outside the state) are not made in accordance with the constitution's enumerated powers, and thus violate the 10th amendment (which is, itself, a part of the constitution)> The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the peopleThat's why several states are pushing back against gun laws, marijuana laws, the TSA, etc: because those laws are not in pursuance of the US Constitution, they do *not* trump state/local laws, and are in fact in violation of the constitution.Thankfully, what LA is trying to pull here is in clear violation of the 1st, and therefore gets trumped by the Supremacy Clause.

> Why is it automatically a statement against a country to alter the flag?I don't know, but it almost always is, and that's how this could be read.>the only flag that was defaced in this situation is the Canadian Pride flag that was cut offThe article itself has a picture of two flags - the "pride" flag and a Canadian flag. The "pride" flag in this case, though, isn't actually the pride flag. It's a Canadian flag where the two red bars are replaced with segments of rainbow flag.That makes it a "defaced" Canadian flag. I'm using "defaced" here as neutrally as I can. I don't mean it to sound like I don't like the *actual* pride flag, or that I don't think it should fly on its own. The fact is, though, that it *is* a "defaced" Canadian flag. Just as it would be with a pot leaf in the middle, for example. I also support legalization, but that *is* a "defaced" flag.

The hardest part would be isolating all the enzymes needed to make THC. I never had to take a biochem lab, so I never learned these techniques, but it would be very time consuming. Once you have the enzymes isolated, you can amplify and sequence the genes that produce them. One issue is that these genes probably contain introns in the genomic DNA, making PCR amplification tricky if not infeasible since the sequence will be too long. An alternative is to isolate the mRNA and amplify that, but then regulatory regions are lost. Obiously this would be much easier if we had the cannabis genome sequenced.Amplifying the mRNA would work fine though if you were just inserting the sequences into a bacterial plasmid. The plasmid could be introduced into bacteria which would then make THC. I guess you'd have to eat the bacterial goo then to get high unless you engineered a way for them to secrete it...I suppose it would also be possible to engineer a virus then that contains the THC enzyme genes to insert them into a plant genome. I'm not an expert on cell culture, but you may also be able to use transfection to insert a plasmid into plant cells and grow them into adults, though the cell walls would pose a problem as well as getting the cells to grow into a whole plant. Something like algae would be easier.

> Social conservatives are more libertarian than social liberalsReally? Both sides aren't ideal (that's why we have our own party), but conservatives are not more socially libertarian than liberals. We can at least get liberals to agree that legalizing marijuana is a good thing.Don't defend this by pointing to the few that support some socially liberal ideas, the vast majority are only socially libertarian on the topic of guns.Both sides are only partly libertarian in either fiscal or social policy and fail nearly completely on the other issues.

I attended the last five meetings of the semester and have been pretty active. We meet once a week to discuss events, both fundraising and club related. Next semester is dedicated to Extravaganja and fundraising for it, and some of those fundraisers are already in the works including a Fundrager, Battle of the Bands, and something else I can't remember. Also, we're working on putting together educational events.Last weekend, some of us (including myself) attended the MassCann meeting (which was a disaster, by the way) and discussed legalization initiatives for '12. We also do events for club members (I went bowling with them a few weeks ago.)

How about you read the law, the one that defines Schedule 1 narcotics:1. The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.2. The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.3. There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.Clearly marijuana does not fit here to any sane, rational person.

Yeah, I never remember anything coming of any of these, but I don't think it's going to matter honestly. I always believed when the first state legalized marijuana there would be an enormous domino effect, but I didn't even think it would happen as fast as it is. I've felt for a long time that legal marijuana was an inevitability, now I just expect it much sooner.

Did you read the paper by any chance?>Taken together, our findings suggest caution in the implementation of policies related to legalization of cannabis for recreational use, as it may lead to greater availability and acceptance of cannabis, reduced perception of risk of use,25 and increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes, such as substance use disorders.That's from the discussion of this paper. >the association of cannabis use with negative mental health outcomes, such as substance use disorders, appears strong.It really bothers me that you are just essentially giving your opinion on unclear science, it's almost analgous to spreading misinformation.

i really don't think there will be this ridiculous drop in price that everyone expects. in holland where it is pretty much legal, it still fetches a decent price and i knew a couple of guys who made a decent living growing and selling to local coffee shops. you might pay about €6 for a gram of something there that would likely cost $20 in the states. sure "big business" may come in and start mass producing a lot of low grade stuff (the budweiser of pot), but there will be people willing to pay more for the small-time local growers who put more TLC into their crops, just like your local breweries.

You need to be able to express yourself freely and love openly who you love before economic freedoms. Not that they aren't important, just that what good is being able to own your own business if you can't marry your homosexual partner and have children together. Or if you're stuck with unwanted children because of limited access to abortions, contraceptives or sex education. Or if you're in prison for smoking weed

Exactly. Some may argue It's better for the kid but I remember growing up with a few kids who's parents smoked and most of them turned out a lot better than the kids who had a parent or two in prison. Throwing a kid's parent in jail over smoking pot leads to a child's freedom with no guidance, It's sad how screwed up our justice system works..

I would be quite interested. If hemp fiber is better for paper manufacture, why isn't it being widely used? It is legal to import fiber to the US, although I am unfamiliar with the economics involved. Is hemp fiber paper widely manufactured in countries where it is legal to grow hemp?

So many things. Off the top of my head:One guy got arrested while at work (for failing to pay child support... Yeah, fast food salaries don't really afford child support payments). The police even waited for him to finish his shift. He was back at work a couple days later.A couple of employees had sex on one of the prep counters. Not fired.The janitor was caught eating frozen Chicken tenders in the freezer. Not fired.Finally, one guy threatened a coworker with a fryer basket dripping with oil and threatened me with a knife (for not letting him eat about $30 worth of food for free). I resigned the next day after he was not fired. Apparently night shift employees are very valuable.That same manager was later fired for smoking pot on the roof. Go figure.

Yes opiates suppress cortisol your stress hormone, to much cortisol wears the immune system down, when you quit all the suppression leads to large releases of cortisol for awhile until your body adjusts. Ashwagandha is an herb that regulates cortisol and helps a lot of other things like sleep and anxiety. I'd recommend it, I'd also recommend eating yogurt or probiotic pills for the GI issues, it will help.

Pot is illegal because William Randolph Hearst ran a smear campaign against marijuana in the 1930s to protect his interests in the timber industry, because hemp was poised to replace wood as an inexpensive raw material for the manufacture of paper.

Probable cause is what the officer needs to arrest you... Once he has the proper probable cause to make the arrest he has the right to search your entire car including locked containers. At that point the search is him investigating the crime of you driving intoxicated. He does not need your consent. Smelling burnt marijuana along with whatever the original reason to stop your vehicle will be good enough to arrest you if he believes you may be impaired.

the rating system if beyond screwed, they just need to list things in the movie, sexual content, violence, gore, drugs, etc and perhaps a more detailed info on the website for parents Sexual content includes teen simulated sex, breast exposed, drug use includes marijuana and cocaine and let parents regulate their kids because the rating system we have is pretty wacked.

the illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world. - Carl Sagan
index: 67227504
**Judaism:** One of the oldest religions. They believe that there is one god, named Yahweh, who created all of humanity/the universe, but the Jews are His specific "holy people." Old Testament of the Bible is their holy book.**Christianity:** Same as Judaism, but they believe that Yahweh, now called God, reincarnated in human form and died so that everyone who is a Christian can enter Heaven.**Islam:** They believe God, known as Allah in Arabic, has had thousands of prophets throughout the years, one for each civilization. Eventually though, God sent his final messenger, Mohammad, to spread the true religion that would not be distorted by time like all the other prophets' were. Their holy Book is the Qu'ran. Muhammed (peace be upon him) didn't write the Quran, because he did not know how to read or write. Rather, it was revealed over a period of 23 years and memorized orally by those around him and finally written down after he had died. The Qu'ran states there is one indivisible God that judges us according to His law.**Hinduism:** One of the oldest religions. Hindus believe in many, many, many different things. The main goal of Hinduism is to progress spiritually. Hindus generally are polytheists, believing in many gods. There are there main gods - Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu, which are the Creator, The Destroyer, and the Preserver. There are thousands of other gods in the pantheon representing other things. These gods are not seen as entirely separate entities, though. These gods, along with you and me and all the trees and rocks and everything in existence, are all "one;" part of the absolute, the Divine. Its a complex philosophy. Hindus also believe in reincarnation. When we die, they believe, we go into the Lokas, or Astral as its called in the West, and then according to our souls "vibration" we are reincarnated on a plane that is accordance to our desires/past actions. The Veda are their holy books.**Buddhism:** They believe in the teachings of Siddhartha Guatama. It is centered around the 4 noble truths and the 8 fold path which state what causes suffering and how to overcome suffering. There are a plethora of different teachings and methods nowadays. Many consider Buddhism a way of life/philosophy rather than a religion. They have no holy book, but rather Sutras which are said to be teachings from the Buddha (Guatama). Buddhism is related to Hinduism in some aspects. **Pagans/Wiccans:** They believe in many things, ranging from polytheistic, to atheistic, to pantheistic. They claim to take their beliefs from the beliefs of the ancient earth religions.**Mormonism:** Its like Christianity, but with some different beliefs. They believe that Joseph Smith was God's prophet. They believe God is a physical entity who lives on a planet that goes around the star Kolob. God had literal sexual intercourse with a human female who gave birth to the savoir, Jesus. The original Jews, they believe, also came from North America.**Catholicism:** A sect of Christianity.**Rastafarian:** They reject Western society. Haile Selassie I was God. He is the Second Coming of Christ. They also believe cannabis is a gift from God.**Atheism:** It is not a religion. It is simply the personal rejection in the belief of a deity. It can be separated into Agnostic Atheism (Weak Atheist) or Gnostic Atheist (Strong Atheism).Hope this helped.

Even selling doesn't garantuee a prison sentence, am I right? You'd have to be caught multiple times... This guy is trying to make it sound like our system is the same exact shitty system from the US, where people caught with 0.1gr of weed their life is ruined and are sent to prison.

Its also Digg, and that's not my problem. Digg doesn't have Karma or any other sort of personal score, only the stories do. Thats why there's no incentive to get a Digg frontpage story about Digg itself (unless Digg actually does something uniquely wrong, like that crap last year with the HD-DVD key) or about any particular Digger. Reddit alternately does incentivize exactly that sort of self-aggrandizing ass-ery ("Vote up if you Voted up the 'Vote up if weed should be legal' thread," etc.) with its Karma system, to the point that, unless you've already got pretty high karma to begin with, the odds of anything you submit actually being read are pretty damn slim, meaning the odds of earning more are even slimmer. I'm not trying to rag on Reddit entirely here, I was just responding to otonzer's Karma question by saying that, the community being what it is, Karma distribution is exceedingly arbitrary and there's really no point stressing about the score.

This was about 3 years ago, me and a few friends were smoking marijuana on an old house where no one used to live. It was around sunset and the house was on the top of a small hill. Two friends were outside getting ready to leave and just about when they stepped outside two cops stopped their motorbikes and was asking them what they were doing inside the old house. One friend was cleaning the bong, another friend was smoking a blunt, one was sitting there clearing the weed to light and I was there watching these cops outside the door. We all stopped doing what we were doing and kept quiet and then one cop decides to open the door. He opens the door and see us all 4 guys, high as hell with illegal weed. He yelled "nobody move, what the fuck is that in your hand?" The cop outside rushed in and we all ran to the second floor and jumped from the balcony. One cop chased from outside the house with his motorbike and we ran like Usain bolt. Luckily all of us got away. Those guys outside the house ran as soon as the cops started chasing us. We survived that day.

They aren't and the can't. That was my point. Since nearly all instances of firearms transfers will require a background check now, a person who decides to use marijuana will not be able truthfully fill out the background check form if they want to practice one of their constitutional rights.

They aren't making it up. Under US federal law marijuana is a Schedule I drug, while amphetamines are a Schedule II drug:>Schedule I substances are those that have the following findings:The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.**The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.****There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.**>Schedule II substances are those that have the following findings:The drug or other substances have a high potential for abuseThe drug or other substances **have currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, or currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions**Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act#Schedules_of_controlled_substances)

To start, I don't think they did Ren and Yella justice. There were also a lot more people involved besides Jerry Heller, but I get for the sake of the movie they made it just one guy. Also didn't really touch too much on the music after the first NWA album and Cube's solo shit. I would have liked to see more of them making music and that whole kind of process, especially DRE with G funk shit, however the movie was pretty long so I realize they tried to shorten things a little. I think they could have ended the storyline a little sooner to do that, they didn't really need to bring in Pac and all that but it was cool to see anyway.Also would have liked to see them show how DRE was never a pro-weed rapper until Snoop, and then it was ALL weed shit. EDIT: something else they did in the movie I didn't agree with is make Dre look like a good guy throughout the entire thing. Obviously it's because Dre produced the shit there's no mention of his scandals like beating Dee Barnes and stuff.

Yeah you absolutely know more about me and my life than I do. We're talking about weed, not crack. Even if it is harder drugs, why do you care so much about what someone else does with their body? Even if all drugs were legal, it's not like doing them would be mandatory. Stop being so judgmental of other people's choices. Edit: and maybe you just know some shit people because no one I know is like that.

Well, that has a lot to do with the taboo nature of even discussing it. If you can't discuss it, how are you supposed to come to a rational, well reasoned conclusion that is "correct".As people have said there are mountains of evidence on both sides... and for a lot of people none of that matters at all because [reasons] (some well founded, others rooted in deep logical fallacies). It's like a lot of the discussion about legalization of marijuana going on in a lot of places in the world currently, there's a healthy contingent that believe because it's "wrong" currently, it should continue to remain "wrong" and never need to be re-evaluated.
index: 87044533
It's sort of an argument through absurdity. If alcohol and cigarettes are legal, substances that are much more harmful then marijuana, then there is no reason that marijuana shouldn't be legal...or alcohol and cigarettes should be outlawed. I'm of the opinion that everything should be legal, regardless of how much it hurts you personally.

They need probable cause to issue you a citation, just like an arrest. In fact in many places you are technically under arrest until you sign the ticket and are released. A search also requires probable cause and if you are in a car then saying they smell weed meets that standard unfortunately.

I really did lol. My friend was pissed that we lost that much weed (cause of course they didn't let us keep it) and I was just like dude... We could be in jail but instead we got a ticket that we didn't even have to pay. Grateful everyday that I got that lucky.

It's not good man. MA really fucked over the little people, they're only issuing 75 cultivation permits at a cost of $18000 apiece. So basically if you're running a smaller operation you're screwed. I'm not sure if selling your own excess as a smaller grower will even be made possible. Big pot really made sure to take out the competition this time.

Oh no no. After about 30 days from now that's it it's gone. You will go to jail for it as if marijuana. CBD oil now carries the same jail sentence as illegal marijuana or heroin.

Sooooo last night me my friend cam and these two girls are sittin in this girls suburban at an elementary school. We are in Seattle and we are vaping with my new polite wispr. We are all high as hell an I turn off the vape and put it in the pocket on the back of the drivers seat. About two minutes later. Lights. There are three pairs of lights that flip on all at once and we are shook. The girl opens her door andvthe cop says stay in the car! About 5 of them come up and open our doors and they ask us if we are taking advantage of the new pot laws.lol. We say no and they tell us about a string of burgurlarys and tell us the neighbors were a bit freaked out. Needless to say we were relieved but still had our hearts beating quite fast. We were all keyed as hell and just drove away.

You want this to be correct so bad... Jail is not prison. They don't do the same thing. This thread is about prison. Most people who go to jail never go to prison. You go to jail for a small bag of weed, not prison. You go to jail for A dui, not prison. And guess where you go for a speeding ticket? Neither of these places.

>But I don't think that escalating violence against men has to come at the expense of services for women.There is a limited amount of resources to be used for domestic violence services. Some men need those services. There is a greater burden of proof for men who claim to have been beaten, and there is a greater barrier to entry for males attempting to get help from the domestic violence shelters.I'm assuming that by "escalating violence against men" you actually meant "advancing services for men". If you think that violence against men should actually be increased, then there is little more worth arguing about.Violence against men SHOULD be stigmatized, to the same extent as violence against women, but it is not. Women who have demonstrated their ability to beat men, however unjustly, are still celebrated in the media.Murder is not the only symptom of domestic violence, is not the only indicator of domestic violence, and is not the only means of domestic violence. Some people would much have a slave than a dead body.The problem is that there is very little support for men who seek to be treated equally under the law, in schools, or in employment. I don't have the stomach to be a counselor for another beaten man. I am simply too wounded and have too short a temper and attention span. Some people can't see blood. I'd advocate hitting the bitch back after she gives him a bloody nose.So I advocate. I attempt to raise awareness. I don't do it perfectly.But each of 40 people can't have $400 from the pot if it only contains $20. to begin with.

Yeah, definitely a federal issue. My understanding is that the federal law enforcement has generally relied on local law enforcement to catch violators of local and federal laws. If the local law enforcement says they won't enforce that federal law (carrying weed across borders) then the federal law enforcement agencies have to allocate more resources to make the arrests themselves.

100% who plead get convicted. The percent who don't are those who win in trial or get a case dismissed.The reason for high conviction rates is because prosecutors give maximum statutory sentences if you take it to trial and lose.Some people have criticized this as making most defendants ignore their right to trial.Say your a first time offender for marijuana or something and they offer you a year and you want to go to trial and then they threaten to give you 10 if you go to trial.. You would plead guilty even if you were innocent right?The federal courts can also suppress and disallow evidence that state courts cannot.

**Lactuca virosa**Lactuca virosa is a plant in the Lactuca (lettuce) genus, ingested often for its mild psychotropic (specifically hypnotic or sedative) effects which are often described as being similar to those of opium. It is related to common lettuce (L. sativa), and is often called wild lettuce, bitter lettuce, laitue vireuse, opium lettuce, poisonous lettuce, tall lettuce, great lettuce or rakutu-karyumu-so.Lactuca virosa is widespread across much of central and southern Europe. It can be found locally in the south east and east of England.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

You can't just have laws, and not enforce them. Otherwise people loose respect for the law. If you want pot legal, you don't just stop enforcing the law, you legalize it. If you just stop enforcing the law, then you risk the next person enforcing it, leading to craziness. Like we are facing now.

There needs to be a case where an employee of a company works at say home or just an inside office job. where the company has no reason to insure you etc. to be fired for recreational use on their own time. That employee will need to sue for wrongful termination and argue that cannabis use on their free time is just the same as drinking at home and has no baring on performance at the work place. Better tests need to be created to determine if the employee was high on the job or just smoked a joint on their free time.Edit: not a good idea to go to work baked off your ass.

It has been shown that socioeconomic inequalities does drive people of color to sell/use drugs outdoors more often than white people. We were talking about crime rates though. His claims seemed to be based on incarceration alone - for marijuana possession, black people get incarcerated far more, but still commit the crime at the same rate. Looking at incarceration rate alone doesn't give you the whole picture. Maybe outdoor usage does contribute - though I would generally concede there are far more and greater factors than that - somewhat to higher incarceration rates, but the actual usage/crime rate remains the same.

> Philando Castile (a black man who was shot after telling police he had a firearm when they pulled his car over) were not defended. Googling this case has a NRA representative point out that Castile was a marijuana user, which means that he lied on his firearms permit, as well as committing the felony of possessing a controlled substance while armed. I don't think we can reasonably expect the NRA to defend him as if he was a legal gun owner.

>If you look at the economy purely from a citizen consumer base, then sure. If you look at the economy on large, then no, not quite. The government's spending counts. And if the government has a huge tax income from something like pot, it has a lot more money to spend on the economy.You are joking, right? The economy is entirely dependent on consumer spending! Even when the government spends to stimulate the economy, it's focus is to encourage consumer spending!>I never said that a tax on pot would fix the economy. Rather, it would help it.A tax does not fix the economy, nor does it help the economy. A tax discourages spending by making goods and services more expensive. The benefit is that it gives a government funds to do governmental things, but making things more expensive never benefits the economy.-------Regardless, we do not need a tax on pot to achieve legalization. There was significant movement toward legalization before the whole "let's tax the shit out of it!" craze, and it will happen without pushing the taxation issue.The more you pay for bud, the less you can spend on cheetos.

I think the issue with comparing Republicans and Democrats is that those terms get blindly tossed in together with Conservative and Liberal. Because by definition, conservatism means less government and liberalism means more government. To call the Republicans completely conservative would be like calling the Democrats completely liberal. The Republicans are generally conservative on the economic side, they are liberal on the social side with the banning of gay marriage, abortion, marijuana laws, etc. While the Democrats are generally conservative on the social side while being much more liberal on the economic side.

You are NOT going to flop a set in those 7.5 times you are in the pot with a pocket pair going into the flop.That is just the chance that you do get a set on the flop with your pocket pair, which should then influence whether or not you even see a flop based on the pot size and the bet to you preflop.

very true. if you need to carry some sort of self defense tool then carry pepper spray. you're going to end up in prison for 2nd degree murder all because you "had to defend yourself" against some guy trying to steal pot from you. things that can go wrong when you carry a knife for self defense:-you pull out a knife, they pull out a gun and shoot you dead.-attacker gets ahold of the knife and now you're being stabbed to death.-I think this would be the most common one in this scenario... you use your knife against someone with no weapon. You seriously injure or kill them and now you're serving time.

So I was sitting on a bench at the esplanade, headphones on and eyes closed jamming to some music around midnight. I had just smoked a bowl, and all of my stuff is sitting on the bench next to me. Pipe, grinder, weed, everything. I'm waiting for some friends to come join me so we can smoke on the docks. Suddenly I hear a voice very faintly, and I open my eyes. Parked right in front of me, less than 10 feet away, is a police car with a spotlight shining on me. I take my headphones off and start scrambling to hide everything and I hear him say through the bullhorn "Get your shit and go home. The park is closed." and he just drives off. I put everything in my bag and left, and on the way I saw the car stop next to other people smoking and tell them to go home too. I've seen them do this a few times, driving through after the park had officially closed and making everyone leave, but they never hassle you out even get out of the car. They just want you to leave because the park is closed and public consumption is still illegal.

Looks like the regulation was changed. When I last looked 5 times with weed was presumptively not "experimentation." Now it's 20 times for pot before age 21 or 5 times after age 21, but none in the last three years. If anyone cares the Reg is under comar 12.04.01.16

For the surgeon general to start recommending that doctors prescribe cannabis it’ll have to at least be federally legal for medicinal use. Of course “doctors” recommend it now, but your run of the mill hospital doctor or physician isn’t allowed to.

Because of the 10th amendment, which states :>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.So basically, the federal government isn't supposed to have the final say over everything. There are some things that the states can make laws on that override federal laws, such as the use of marijuana for non-medical use.However, if the Supreme Court gets involved, their ruling is final. If the Constitution grants the federal government authority to legislate in an area, it can (but need not) override state law in the same area.**TL;DR: The Federal Government can only exercise the power that the Constitution gives it, if they don't have the power, it is vested in the states.**

Economic issues affect more people than social issues, excepting maybe reproductive rights. Gay rights only directly affect the [~5% of people who are LGBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States), marijuana legalization only directly affects the [~10% of the population that smokes](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/prevalence-marijuana-use-among-us-adults-doubles-over-past-decade) (although the true number is likely much lower given all the states who have legalized in recent years and the selective enforcement/lack of enforcement in many areas), and issues facing racial minorities should be pretty self-explanatory. While these aren't reasons to ignore these issues it makes it very easy to see why they aren't taken seriously by large chunks of the population, who are primarily affected by broad economic issues that also affect many, if not most, of the people in all of those other groups.

A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselfs in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you ckoke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile.

You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john.

I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.the only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of your of whay you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

if i have to guess it’s because cortisol which regulate stress and sleep/wake cycle might be messed up from fractional sleep you trying to do here. and in turn, when you normally wake up at 6:30 , cortisol rise and you can’t suppose to make it come down low enough to sleep by 7 or 8 which delay your sleep and your waking time to 10 or 11. and cause unbalance and hence the noon nap,Normally, you want your cortisol to dip down low, so you take one long sleep and then when cortisol rise you could stay awake and active through out the day, that’s how circadian rhythm works.there are many ways to solve your problem but i don’t think it could be long-term solution.i suggest you take adaptogen herbs(valerian roots,or ashwagandha)which help lowering cortisol and melatonin after your work, and in combination do cold shower or hot bath(some people reacts to cold shower better cause it lowers their core temp and it helped getting to sleep much deeper).At least you could get really deep sleep by 5-6 hours before you have to wake up at 6

Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer; however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers. Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers. Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.

> just let the judge know the situation with my lawyer? And then, where would we go from there? That's terrible advice. Yes, don't go then if the lawyer doesn't show and he doesn't show, there may be a warrant out for his arrest.Bottom line, you go to the hearing. If the lawyer knows and doesn't show you tell the judge the lawyer was informed and you don't know where the lawyer is. Maybe the judge tells you to call the lawyer again or maybe the judge has the prosecutor or his own clerk to call the lawyer. You showed up though so it's not you that's in the wrong and you complied with your court dates. Just don't say you're going to ditch your lawyer and represent yourself. It's pretty common in criminal cases for there to be several continuances for the defendant to pay his attorney. Otherwise, if the attorney gets the case dismissed, gets a plea deal, or a trial done and still hasn't gotten paid, there's little incentive for the defendant to ever pay the lawyer since the end result has already been reached. I wonder where you are from that people get jail time for a first time marijuana possession case. Presumably this is a misdemeanor offense although it's not specified.

**The best defense is a good offense**. * Some tips for trading damage: fight with your creeps so they help you deal dps. This is huge dps and the longer he fights you inside your creeps, the more damage he takes. Don't chase him to his creeps though, they'll deal the same damage back to you.* Don't spam abilities early on to farm, you'll run oom or open yourself to harass when your opponent sees your spells are on cooldown.* Buy lots of pots to start out with if you face a very aggressive laner. If you're pro you can use fort pot to trade damage / survive an ignite. * Ping for a jungle gank. Nothing a jungler likes more than a enemy top laner who keeps pushing lane and exposing himself to a gank. Ez kill. Certain champions like Darius can't be beaten alone if you're a melee top champ, but because Darius's abilities push the wave, this leaves him susceptible even to ganks.

Then when I invaded him next time I dropped a Divine Blessing near an edge, and killed him when he picked it up.

Some examples of substances listed in schedule I are: heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), peyote, methaqualone, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“ecstasy”).the bullshit is unbelievable.

It's not saying that. Drug-induced violence means violence where the perpetrator is on drugs at the time. People are way more likely to assault someone drunk than on weed or heroin. Gang violence over turf is prohibition-induced violence, not drug-induced.

Racism played very big part in it too. Harry Anslinger's most famous quote is: *There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others. Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men.*[Article about racism and pot here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/14/marijuana-prohibition-racist_n_4590190.html)

I believe so, what I have seen is 6 plants growing and 6 plants flowering (Dont quote me though)But you should still be able to grow.From Mass. GovAre qualifying patients eligible for marijuana while the program is being implemented?Yes. During the time DPH is implementing this program, the ballot measure allows the written recommendation of a qualifying patient’s physician to serve as a medical marijuana registration card. Similarly, the law allows a qualifying patient to cultivate his or her own limited supply of marijuana during this period. A certifying physician may issue a written certification only for a qualifying patient with whom the physician has a bona fide physician-patient relationship. Under the law, until its program is implemented, DPH is not involved in regulating any recommendations between physicians and patients for the medical use of marijuana, or in defining the limited cultivation registration. DPH has clarified in its final regulations that these provisions of the law will remain in effect until further notice. Even though final regulations are in FAQ on place now, patients may continue to visit physicians for certification, and to possess legally allowable amounts of medical marijuana as defined in the regulations, before DPH’s anticipated online registration system is available.DPH will notify the public on its medical marijuana website, www.mass.gov/medicalmarijuana, when this system is operational and must be used.

All the Obama administration.War without congressional approval? Clearly that wasn't Congress's doing.Naked scanners? TSA expansion? Again, this is a department WITHIN the Obama administration.Drone war? All Obama administration. Congress doesn't tell those drones where to go and what to do.State-secrets privilege? All the Obama administration. Congress doesn't fight these court battles, they're not in the executive branch.Federal raids of medical marijuana? All the Obama administration.Attempt to negotiate to keep troops in Iraq? All the Obama administration.Reauthorization of Patriot Act? Passed by Congress, signed (happily) by the President.Economic team made up of wall street insiders? All Obama.

Let do a thought experiment. You could do it in real life but you would need a 100 ohm potentiometer rated for 6 Watts.Let set the power supply to 12V and 0.5A. Connect a 100 ohm variable resistor across it. Do the math here: you'll see 0.12 amps.Set the pot lower. The voltage will stay the same but the current will increase due to ohms law. At 60 ohms, 0.2A. At 40 ohms, 0.3A.All the while the power supply is in *voltage mode*, putting out 12V and letting the current flow as the load and ohms law dictates. If you adjust the voltage setting, the current will change accordingly (unless you set it too high... then see below).Keep going! Set the pot to 24 ohms. Now the current is 0.5A, the limit you set on the dial. What happens when you go to 22 ohms? The power supply will limit the current to 0.5A, it does this by lowering the voltage to 11V. At 18 ohms, the voltage drops to 9V, all the while you're seeing 0.5A. This is *current mode*. If you adjust the current setting, the voltage will change accordingly (unless you set it so high that the supply goes back into voltage mode)

Kids will do stupid/illegal things. I know this will get buried in the comments, but kids will experiment with vaping, smoking weed/cigarettes, and alcohol. Its important to warn your kids of the dangers of drugs and alcohol at a young age, but trust them to be responsible with their choices.

If an officer claims to smell marijuana in your car and requests a search, can that be considered probable or reasonable cause for the officer to act? Odor obviously cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, making it your word against the cop's if he were to find anything - whether he told the truth about the scent or not.In my small town, the bullying police officers always seem to use that tactic (whether there is actually marijuana to be smelled or not.)Also, along the same lines, what constitutes a "search"? Is it legal for a cop to shine his flashlight into your car without consent?

Trees are the gift from God.He said in Genesis that he gave us ALL seed baring plants for us to consume, use, and enjoy!I strongly believe in God. And I know our lord intended us to use this wonderful plant to our liking.The bible warns of mankind banning a creation of nature, when it is not in their jurisdiction to do so.God foresaw the prohibition of cannabis.I'm not saying go to church and believe whatever that preacher tells you. On the contrary, I think a lot of churches are corrupt and evil. Form a relationship with God on your own terms. Pray. Give thanks. Ask and you shall receive!Be a good person, and you shall be rewarded by our Lord.Followers of God master race! [6]

I do not support mandatory minimums in any form but it is more than a little disengenuous to pretend a party must support all mandatory minimums or none at all. Research has shown mandatory minimums do not have an effect on crime reduction, but that does not necessarily mean there is no role for mandatory minimums in the justice system. In addition to the rehabilitation aspect of corrections, there is also a punishment aspect. It simply does not follow that because there is a minimum penalty for first degree murder, that there should also be a minimum penalty for marijuana posession.This issue of mandatory minimums is slightly more nuanced than saying one must either be in favor of mandatory minimums for all crimes or none at all. For example, look at the case of Leroy Smickle. In his case, the mandatory minimum sentence for gun posession was deemed to be cruel and unusual by the Ontario Court of Appeal and was struck down. Remarkably, the court was able to deem one particular case of a mandatory minimum to be unconstitutional, while not simultaneously ruling every single mandatory minimum to be unconstitutional. I am afraid your argument does not hold much water.

* They're made resilient to herbicides, not pesticides (generally pesticides don't kill plants...). You're thinking of RoundUp Ready crops...and RoundUp is a weed killer.* Modern pesticides are less "strong" and more selective in what they target than traditional pesticides. Meanwhile, USDA Organic certification permits copper pesticides and fungicides, which are widely used. Copper kills practically everything. (And heavy metal poisoning is no joke.) Copper definitely kills bees.* GM crops have delivered a superior pest control system in the form of Bt Corn, which drastically cuts pesticide use and only targets pests that actually eat the plant, leaving all others alone. Plants naturally produce a range of pesticides (hell, some trees even secrete compounds from their roots to poison other trees...). So Bt corn is made to produce the Bt compound found in many caterpillars, alongside its natural defences. It's harmless to mammals, but it pokes holes in the digestive tracts of insects that eat the corn.* GM tech can and is used to make blight-resistant crops, boost nutritional values (e.g. golden rice has higher vitamin count to correct regional deficiencies) and improve hardiness and shelf life without sacrificing flavour (as is currently common with traditionally bred crops. Shelf life for shipping is favoured over quality).

Let's realize that if you make it profitable (HEMP), you make it possible.Start with composite lumber, rope, textiles and oil. You make the truth common, about the benefits of this industry, and you will turn dip shits like that guy, into the biggest proponents for further legalization efforts. Or it will turn smoking weed, into a cheap commodity because it will be easily hidden.Why do they hate hemp?Because most people can't tell the difference.

A union, when it's working well for it's members, is a way for the employees of an organization to collect some of the wealth and revenue controlled by that organization's owners.The problem with public sector unions is that the "owners" are the public; so a public sector union is a way for part of the public to collect the wealth of the broader public. As you've mentioned, this is further complicated by the fact that the public sector does not have to respond to market forces in the same way the private sector does: they can always raise taxes, which makes an even bigger pot for the public-sector unions to demand their share of.At the same time, at least in Canada, the public sector is not some paradise of slack, amazing conditions, and giant pay cheques, so I see some room for the legitimacy of some form of public-sector labour organizations.

No need to get passive-aggressive. European integration process is a thing - it even has it's own Wiki page in which it is described as:> European integration is the process of industrial, political, legal, economic, social and cultural integration of states wholly or partially in Europe. European integration has primarily come about through the European Union and its policies.So is that a melting pot or not? Giving the "success" of European Union aren't we melted already to the certain extent in this pot?

It would be profitable to almost every *government* to legalize.Very many companies have products that cannabis can directly compete with, and if it were made legal in all forms, these companies would either have to spend a large amount of money to convert to new ways of making their products utilizing cannabis or go out of business to the companies who already have ways of using it.

The law regarding marijuana in Colorado allows for cities and counties to decide for themselves if they will permit recreational stores.**Does Colorado Springs have marijuana retail stores?**Many cities and counties within Colorado have chosen not to allow the retail sale of marijuana within their jurisdiction's limits. This includes Colorado Springs and El Paso County as well as Teller County.**What about nearby counties?**Teller County, which includes Victor and Cripple Creek, CO have also opted out of retail marijuana sales. Manitou Springs and Fremont County (Canon City area) have both approved retail marijuana shoppes and are looking to open locations in the coming months. We recommend reaching out to each municipality for more detailed information.

The smart move is to take *some* weed, then drive back around and make sure that you get the same guy at the drive-thru, and give him the bag back and ask for the right order. Say you don't want anything to do with what you had, but you just want your food and call it a day.Then don't report anything. If this guy goes to jail for 2 years, you know where he's going when he comes out.

The raptor does not adjust power (amps) but rather adjusts voltage. The Naos Raptor (and OKR for that matter) adjust voltage using a switching regulator. So when you adjust the pot, it changes the frequency of the power switching, changing the output voltage. The ripple is much much much less (which is better) than a PWM controlled voltage. Were you planning on just using the mosfet at a set voltage and just PWM it to create variable voltage? You should be able to do that no problem, but make sure you code it as RMS and not mean. The arduino might be able to measure ohms and volts as well. Although you'll need to divide the voltage so it doesn't blow out the arduino input pins.

It's because the alcohol and tobacco lobbies are gargantuan and powerful, while opposition lobbies are weak. To the contrary, anti-cannabis lobbies are powerful and well-funded (namely, the same alcohol lobbies above) while pro-legalization lobbies are weak. That's the only difference. Sad but true.

2 answers:First answerOhms law only applies to resistors.If you have a set of resistors in series, then the current is **the same** (not constant) in all the resistors. But the voltage across a given resistor can change is the resistor is variable! So, if you have a resistor and a potentiometer is series, they both see the same current, but the voltage on the pot depends on where you place its shaft.Second answer.A series circuit could be made up of all sorts of components, not just resistors. For example, what if your series circuit is made up of a battery and a resistor? Yes, the current in both is the same, but the voltage across the battery will drop as it gets discharged. Ohm's law doesn't apply to a battery voltage.> Isn't current directly proportional to voltage (Ohm's law)?Only is one case: a resistor of a fixed value.

In many jurisdictions the laws extend to all prescription medications. Controlled substances are all prescribed medications or drugs with no approved medical use. Controlled substances are classified by Schedules. Here are the schedules:>Definition of Controlled Substance Schedules>Drugs and other substances that are considered controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) are divided into five schedules. An updated and complete list of the schedules is published annually in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) §§ 1308.11 through 1308.15. Substances are placed in their respective schedules based on whether they have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, their relative abuse potential, and likelihood of causing dependence when abused. Some examples of the drugs in each schedule are listed below.>Schedule I Controlled Substances>Substances in this schedule have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse.>Some examples of substances listed in Schedule I are: heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), peyote, methaqualone, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("Ecstasy").>Schedule II/IIN Controlled Substances (2/2N)>Substances in this schedule have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.>Examples of Schedule II narcotics include: hydromorphone (Dilaudid®), methadone (Dolophine®), meperidine (Demerol®), oxycodone (OxyContin®, Percocet®), and fentanyl (Sublimaze®, Duragesic®). Other Schedule II narcotics include: morphine, opium, codeine, and hydrocodone.>Examples of Schedule IIN stimulants include: amphetamine (Dexedrine®, Adderall®), methamphetamine (Desoxyn®), and methylphenidate (Ritalin®).>Other Schedule II substances include: amobarbital, glutethimide, and pentobarbital.>Schedule III/IIIN Controlled Substances (3/3N)>Substances in this schedule have a potential for abuse less than substances in Schedules I or II and abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.>Examples of Schedule III narcotics include: products containing not more than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit (Tylenol with Codeine®), and buprenorphine (Suboxone®).>Examples of Schedule IIIN non-narcotics include: benzphetamine (Didrex®), phendimetrazine, ketamine, and anabolic steroids such as Depo®-Testosterone.>Schedule IV Controlled Substances>Substances in this schedule have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule III.>Examples of Schedule IV substances include: alprazolam (Xanax®), carisoprodol (Soma®), clonazepam (Klonopin®), clorazepate (Tranxene®), diazepam (Valium®), lorazepam (Ativan®), midazolam (Versed®), temazepam (Restoril®), and triazolam (Halcion®).>Schedule V Controlled Substances>Substances in this schedule have a low potential for abuse relative to substances listed in Schedule IV and consist primarily of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics.>Examples of Schedule V substances include: cough preparations containing not more than 200 milligrams of codeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams (Robitussin AC®, Phenergan with Codeine®), and ezogabine.https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/

Most people that think they’re getting cocaine is getting crack disguised as cocaine. A lot of people are misinformed with the drug and while yes it is dangerous, in moderation it is not that bad. But it’s way more addictive than alcohol or weed and hell maybe the same cigarettes. Because of highly addictive it is I wouldn’t legalize it all. It gives people readily available coke, and cause more OD’s cause the thing that stops people from taking more is the fact it’s expensive and it’s harder to get.

Smoked some weed with the GF for the first time in a while last night after we went out to eat. Went to bed early, got a good night's sleep, and woke up around 9:30.Already got my groceries for the week, and I'm finishing up my assignment for grad school, with basketball on all day.Once again, it's insane how weed is illegal but I could have been borderline concussed and unproductive this morning if I would have had my normal saturday night drinking.

Americans are quite familiar with being the invading force in a war. I believe what /u/reeferrabbit meant was that Americans have not experienced war on their own homeland where a foreign force occupies your cities and kills and imprisons your people in the same way most European countries have.

When a drunk man beats his wife do you say "it was the alcohol's fault, he'd never have beaten his wife if he was sober, he stopped after he got arrested last time. It's been MONTHS since he beat her while he was sober?" Or do you just say that he's a man that beats his wife?I'm sorry about what happened to your friend but 8 of you smoked, presumably, the same weed but only one of you killed himself on a bike. Maybe he wasn't as over it as you've been telling yourself.

Then she was being kept from me and my family by the mom while the mom and bf were molesting her. I couldn't get a hold of the mom or find them. A friend turned them in and they're both in jail now and my daughter lives with my dad while I visit her and fight for reunification. Everyone said that the mom was harboring her from me so I guess that's the wrong word. The mom blocked everyone and changed her numbers and during that time her and the bf were molesting her. So...does anyone know anything about the marijuana situation or is everyone gonna keep speculation that I'm some how a danger to my daughter or I'm making shit up? God fuck reddit. Seriously.

Ok, I'm game. Explain how prostitution is a moral crime in a completely secular society?On your second point, I agree that it is dictatorial to impress my beliefs on others. Which is why I make an effort not to. However, saying that we don't as a society doesn't change the nature of what is true. How many people are in jail for marijuana-related crimes? Can anyone make an argument that those laws weren't written by someone with a misguided sense of principles? How can we say that something is true, when it clearly is not? We make moral decision for other people every single time we legislate something that doesn't hurt someone else.TL;DR: I agree with your principle, but in practice I still think you're wrong.

Currently only medical marijuana businesses will be allowed to even apply for the license to sell retail marijuana. You need a separate license to be a medical marijuana business so in essence you will need two licenses. Non medical marijuana businesses will not be able to apply for a license until mid-2015 for most of the state, later for Denver. Personal sales are illegal and will remain so without a completely separate constitutional amendment.

Because the barrel jack connector expects 7-12v and goes through a voltage regulator to bring it down to a stable 5v, the regulator chip itself drops about 1v MINIMUM from the source so he'd be undervolting the 5v arduino board.

Piz. This is what the article said OThe Standard Cultivation License, in addition to cultivation, permits a holder to sell cannabis in accordance with subsection 11(5) of the Cannabis Regulations. This new license authorizes RoyalMax to sell dried cannabis flower, seeds and plants to other qualified license holders:a holder of a licence for micro-cultivation or standard cultivation,a holder of a licence for processing,a holder of a licence for analytical testing,a holder of a licence for research,a holder of a cannabis drug licence; and,it further allows sale and distribution of cannabis plants and seeds to a holder of a nursery licence or, to a holder of a license for sale, or a person authorized to sell cannabis under a provincial act.

This is a more well put together argument than the one I make, but it's basically the same thing.

Sorry to hear that.Hang in there. If you have been smoking a lot of cannabis for a long time, then it can take some time for your brain to return to normal without it. The CB1 receptors in your brain that help regulate mood and pleasure might be [desensitized and downregulated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414724/). Try to be compassionate with yourself and give yourself time to adapt to daily life without cannabis. If you feel very angry, irritable, or depressed, try to understand that at least part of those feelings are probably due to your brain trying to adjust to not having the stimulus from THC that it has been accustomed to.You may also need to develop new habits and psychological thought patterns. If you are used to using cannabis for self-soothing or relaxation, then you may need to try to find other outlets. Try to read a book or find a new hobby.
index: 46736557
To answer your question, yes. The psychological withdrawals from the rush of dopamine that weed provided was an emotional damper. Now that your brain is aware that you are not chemically providing it with something that was pleasurable, it's also going haywire because it doesn't know how to handle the stress of every day life. That stress is causing you to have abnormal levels of anxiety. The surest way to decrease your anxiety and regulate to a healthy level of stress is to do many of the things that are recommended on this sub: exercise, eat healthier, find a new hobby, and meditate. Creating these healthy habits will improve your overall quality of life and mental coping mechanism. To fall asleep easier, drink some chamomile tea and take some melatonin. You will find that decreasing your anxiety and stress levels will give you more peace of mind. Stay strong my friends - remember, it's never too late to enjoy so much of what this life has to offer! Peace :)

Homemade Salsa -4 to 5 average sized tomatoes -3-5 Jalapenos (depending on how spicy you like it) -2 head's garlic -1 lemon -1 lime -1 cilantro (pre clumped grocery size) -1 red onion -Extra Virgin Olive Oil -Salt and Pepper to taste Place Garlic in baking dish, I use a meat loaf like pan for it's smaller size. Cover liberally with EVOO. Cook in oven at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or till soft. When done, let it sit it will be extremely hot. Cook Tomatoes and Jalapenos, on stove placing pot or some cover on top to keep condensation inside (if weather doesn't permit, can be made on stove top with a small amount of water placed in pan). Cook Tomatoes till you see blackened skin (on stove top till they're tender and mushy to touch). Cook Jalapenos till blackened on grill, on stove same length as tomatoes. Cut up Cilantro into smaller, fine pieces and set aside. Do same with red onion and jalapenos. When Tomatoes are cool enough to handle, place in bowl and smash up with a potatoe masher or any like instrument. Once beaten to a desired consistency, mix in Jalapenos, Garlic, Red Onion, Cilantro, Lemon, Lime, Salt and Pepper to taste. Allow to refrigerate for 8-24 hours for flavors to meld.

It's not legal to use in public so most people don't. The people who smoke all day err day have such a high tolerance you won't even be able to tell they are high. There's just a shit load of pot stores in some neghiborhoods, some have none. Nothing has really changed, the stoners are still smoking and the non smokers are still non smokers.

If you use a smaller heat source, like a hotplate (or maybe an open-top electric pot) paired with a thermostatic controller and sensor, you can build a rig to accurately regulate your temperature. (Basically you are making a homemade sous-vide)I used [heating wraps for car batteries] (http://imgur.com/GnKiENE) and [digital temperature controllers] (http://imgur.com/Z2iqK17) to build thermally-controlled propane tank heaters for our coffee roaster (to maintain consistent gas pressure). I'm sure you could adapt the principle using an appropriate relay and sensor for your heating device. [This] (http://www.amazon.com/Elitech-All-Purpose-Temperature-Controller-Thermostat/dp/B008KVCPH2/ref=pd_sim_indust_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=10GS75ZK14XMDTBE2J7W) is what I used and I know it isn't correct for your application, but it will give you an idea of what type of device to look for.

Oh please, stop trying to curve such bullshit reasoning. That's what YOU'RE implying, not the paper. There is zero concrete evidence in what is being *implied*. This is a scientific paper. It exists for the sole purpose of spreading information. If they have any accusations about marijuana or it's legality they would have said so; there is no such rhetoric in the article.

Attorney General Eric Holder said at a press conference Wednesday that the Justice Department will no longer raid medical marijuana clubs that are established legally under state law. His declaration is a fulfillment of a campaign promise by President Barack Obama, and marks a major shift from the previous administration.After the inauguration, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) continued to carry out such raids, despite Obama’s promise. Holder was asked if those raids represented American policy going forward.“No,” he said. “What the president said during the campaign, you’ll be surprised to know, will be consistent with what we’ll be doing in law enforcement. He was my boss during the campaign. He is formally and technically and by law my boss now. What he said during the campaign is now American policy.”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/26/holder-vows-to-end-raids_n_170119.html

I was twenty and went to my drug dealers house to pick up some weed . Excited of how it looked and smelled i walked out of his house dancing. I get in the car and as i pull into the road a cop is parked hidden behind a bush with his lights on hardly leaving me with any room to make my turn. I instantly looked at my friend with the expression of "well fuck" as the cop proceeded to pull into the driveway and turn around. Long story short we both went to jail that night.

The "Suspended slab" technique is very popular is some areas. Wherein you'd use a large suspended concrete slab as the base of your garage, and build a basement room underneath. This is used most commonly for sophisticated marijuana gardens. Most often illegal for the purpose of hiding the heat signature that H.I.D lights produce. This heat signature can be picked up with various equipment.

I keep hearing about street sellers going out of business because people would rather go to a non sketchy, fully legal place, and the prices are getting competitive now and even beating street price. I even met a couple of people who used to sell cannabis on the street who were put out of business by the legal prices lowering so much. Obviously my experience is anecdotal, but I keep reading about dealers going out of business when places not only legalize, but start lowering their prices to close to street price on decent quality product. A big factor is how much the legal cannabis costs.

The car search warrant exception is pretty complicated. But basically any time a cop pulls you over he can order you out of the vehicle. The reasoning behind it is officer safety (driver could have a gun in the glove box, for instance) but the officer doesn't need a specific or articulable reason to feel threatened. He DOES, however, need probable cause to search your vehicle. The car smelling of marijuana pretty much always give the officer probable cause. And going back to what the OP mentioned about the black box (which had a lock) once the officer has PC to search the vehicle, he has the right to search all containers therein, locked or unlocked. He does NOT, however, have the right to search the trunk; only the passenger compartment. If an arrest was made due to finding contraband in the passenger compartment, the vehicle will be impounded and then the trunk will be searched under the inventory search exception. So, moral of the story is: don't give the cops probable cause. Definitely don't give them consent to search your car. And if you are traveling with drugs, the best place for them is the trunk, because you would have to be arrested for something else and have your vehicle impounded before the cops can search there.

> The Olympics are supposed to be a moment to transcend our national struggles and come together in celebration of universal effort and achievement.Really? I remember being told that in grade school. I think it was the same day they told me that pot makes you kill babies and not to talk about Santa Claus in front of the other kids.Grown ups ALWAYS question oppressive regimes like China, the Bush Administration and Putin & Co(tm) in any setting.

Oh no it wasn't a destination, just passed it while getting a ride home. I have no problem with people using pot and I have said it should be legal, but I think all drugs should be legal and those that do dumb shit while on drugs should be punished for the dumb shit they do. To each their own I always say, if you aren't hurting anyone but yourself you should have that right.

I agree with that to some degree. It's not all good and it's not completely harmless, but neither is something like alcohol. The fact of the matter is that for some people marijuana is not safe, especially if it's being used heavily, but in my opinion it's a double-standard to say that about marijuana while alcohol is still perfectly legal.

>Marijuana has short term and long term mental and physical side effects. Plus, marijuana is addictive.Coffee also has both short term and long term mental and physical side effects, and is **dozens of times** more addictive.

Oh, and another friend, I gave 5 grams too, literally just *Gave*, I wouldn't sell cause, well, dealing's bad, and I got it for free, and I loved her, one of my best friends, so, yeah, and I also gave her a couple bottles of wine I had gotten from my uncle that I didn't like, well, her mum found them. Immediately she said 'Kasey gave it all to me, I don't even know what it is!'. She was banned from seeing me ever again and her mum called and told my mum what happened and bitched her out. My mum knew all of this already, so she told her to fuck right off. Then told me to never give weed away again cause that's what happens. Saw her mum in the market a couple days later and she started freaking out at me. I was kind of a bitch and had quite the temper then so I screamed right back at her and told her she's a crazy cunt, and if I ever see her daughter outside of school again I'd destroy her, and that her daughter has drank more than I ever have - had literally tried it once at that point, didn't like it - and that her daughter was borderline alcoholic. we were 16, by the way. Was lovely. There's other stories, but eh. All the friends I've ever had that smoked pot have fucked me over in some way, or attempted to... It's just shitty.

Another way to think of it is a constant voltage power supply with a current limit built in. You can make a linear current regulator with just a couple transistors and resistors, then use a constant voltage supply to feed it (taking into account the minimum voltage drop through the current regulator).Better yet, you can adjust max output voltage and current with [one of these](http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-Buck-Converter-Constant-Current-5-30V-to-1-25-26V-Step-Down-Voltage-Regulator-/370783439333?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item56546a49e5), and it will be more efficient because it's a switching supply that does everything in one switching stage.Adjust the constant current pot with the output shorted through a multimeter in amp mode, and adjust the voltage pot with it in voltmeter mode with no load. This will help ensure that any regulation error is towards the side of caution as you're adjusting it in the modes where it should regulate out the highest (more load usually suppresses voltage a little, less load usually suppresses current a little).

I think the claim that crime is down 15% is somewhat spurious anyways. I do think crime has probably been steady or perhaps even down a bit since legalization. As far as legalization itself decreasing the crime rate directly, I don't think that it would have much impact because possession of small amounts of marijuana had already been decriminalized in Colorado since 1973 The crime numbers that they are using for the decrease in crime are specifically property crimes in Denver for the period January-March 2014 compared to January-March 2013. Not only is the time period to short to show a trend, they focused only on the type of crime that saw the biggest decrease and ignored the other areas of crime. Over that period some types of crime saw a decrease some saw an increase, but again the time period was too short to see any kind of trend.

I have a very open mind about drugs. I believe strongly in the idea of reducing drug addiction, violence, and abuse through harm reduction and education rather than the "war on drugs" that has been used for decades in the United States. I'm also pro legalization for marijuana, as well as schedule reduction for a handful of drugs (LSD and MDMA specifically) as I believe they have been wrongly demonized via media and government in the past.

"Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer; however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers. Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time." --NIDAIt can still cause cancer. It just isn't common. And it's still not very good for your lungs. I vape weed and I used to smoke. I'm not trying to call you out. As for cancer patients, marijuana is usually used to treat pain. Morphine was used to treat heroin addictions.

Yeah I'm aware Sessions' anti-pot stance. I guess we will just have to wait and see what happens.

I don't think people making the alcohol/cannabis harm comparison are saying that alcohol causes too much harm. They are saying (in general anyway) that alcohol causes more harm than cannabis yet is legal. Most arguing so would say that the level of harm caused by alcohol is acceptable- otherwise the argument is weak and can easily be countered simply by saying that alcohol should also be banned or heavily restricted.

classifying marijuana as an ILLEGAL DRUG surrounds the user with the world of ILLEGAL DRUGS.when prohibition was in effect, drinking took place at speak-easys, the same sort of underground setting that lawmakers are relegating marijuana users to.if you ask me, making marijuana illegal makes it MORE LIKELY to be a gateway drug by surrounding the user with people (drug dealers, their clientèle, and those who do use harder drugs) more likely to influence their choices negatively.

Hearst didn't want that sort of competition for paper manufacturing, so, with the help of politicians, he launched a smear campaign against marijuana until it was eventually outlawed.

Aw did I upset you? Damn youre sensitive. And it is the same thing, im amazed youre unware that ABQ and RR are different cities and that ABQs mayor isnt responsible for RR laws. Thats basic knowledge and if you cant even comprehend that, youre pretty fucking stupid, my friend. Keep smoking weed before job interviews. I'm sure you'll be a success in life. =)

I think they realize that a lot of people would just grow it themselves. Alcohol prohibition repeal gave a lot of business back to large producers and took away from smaller "bootleggers", but cannabis is easier to grow. It's even easier than tobacco. Plenty of people would buy it at the store but plenty would grow it at home. If legal to do outdoors, 3 medium MJ plants next to tomatoes and peppers in a garden would supply me for most of the year for free.

Putting non-violent offenders in prison creates violent people. Prisons are fucked up places. As a child, I spent six months in a boot camp for people getting released from prison and probation violators (I violated probation for cannabis).

Either way, the end of marijuana prohibition is truly inevitable. The issue isn't even really whether public opinion shifts in favor of ending prohibition, though it is shifting. The issue is that prohibition is an unsustainable policy. But if Mexico goes ahead with legalization, I'll think we'll see prohibition end sooner in the US.

No - my point is that limited law enforcement resources require there to be some degree of prioritization of resources. In states where there are no local or state resources available to fight marijuana as a whole, it makes more sense to prioritize those who are breaking both local, state, AND federal marijuana laws.For example, you'll see the DEA and local/state police raiding dispensaries in Colorado/California/etc that are in violation of the local/state laws, but you won't really see them going after those in compliance with the state laws.In this way, our limited federal law enforcement resources aren't wasted fighting a losing battle. It's not that they can't enforce the laws, just that to do so would require reducing resources for other law enforcement priorities.

Prosecution can present its own difficulties. I didn't exactly enjoy my first really tough case on my own in a lower district court in a state in the South: it was a domestic violence case where the defendant was accused of attacking basically his whole family over a dispute regarding stolen 'cash.'Took a defense attorney with fifteen years of experience about a minute to get my complainant-witness to admit the cash wasn't cash, but weed. The judge asked me why he should credit an admitted liar's testimony over the defendant's. I couldn't really answer him, and the case didn't go my way. Whatever, you win some, you lose some. But the cases where you talk a witness into going up and doing something courageous- standing up to their abuser, etc.- and that witness lets you down on the stand? Not great

That's ignoring the social stigma of steroid use versus marijuana use. The latter is much more accepted across many demographics. The former, not so much. In fact, it's by and large reviled. I don't think it's the legal thing which matters most, but the social effects of admitting use.

> Asset forfeiture is another way law enforcement agencies have come to rely on marijuana as a funding source. Police departments, through a process known as asset forfeiture, seize cash and property associated with drug busts, including raids relating to marijuana. The proceeds from the seizures are often distributed to law enforcement agencies. Nice find. Whenever any organization or individual profits from a crime, they have an incentive for that crime to exist and that's a conflict of interest. Fuck these guys for that.

>States can expressly deny any Federal law they choose, and the Feds can simply exclude them from the programs. No they can't. Every time a state has tried to do this it's been slapped down. > "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution specifically says that state laws can not trump federal laws, making the 10th Amendment invalid as an argument for states being able to nullify federal laws> "The Court, in a 6–3 decision, ruled that the imposition of that obligation on the states violated the Tenth Amendment. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the federal government can encourage the states to adopt certain regulations through the spending power (e.g. by attaching conditions to the receipt of federal funds, see South Dakota v. Dole), or through the commerce power (by directly pre-empting state law). However, Congress cannot directly compel states to enforce federal regulations."Assuming that O'Connor actually said this, it does not mean that states are free to dis-regard federal law. What it means is that when a federal law is passed the federal government can not require a state to enforce it without providing it the means to do so. In the case of marijuana laws the federal government can not require state governments to aid them in investigating or prosecuting federal marijuana laws.
index: 49144553
>How will that affect state and local law enforcement activities concerning cannabis?It means local and state law enforcement won't give the feds any help when they do a raid. The DEA relies heavily on cooperation from local law enforcement to carry out their raids. California is taking that help away which will severely limit what the DEA can do.
index: 55807477
>How or more importantly, Why is this legal? It's a plant...It's not a naturally-occurring plant. Monsanto took a standard plant and modified its genetic code so that it would have certain desirable traits. For instance, normally the weed killer glyphosate (better known as Roundup) kills both weeds and desirable crop plants, meaning that it can't be used after the crops sprout. It does this by blocking the activity of a certain enzyme necessary for plant growth. Monsanto discovered a bacteria that possessed a form of the enzyme that could not be blocked by glyphosate. They then spliced the gene from the bacteria into the genetic code of several different kinds of crop plants. Now, these crops don't get killed by glyphosate, allowing farmers to spray their fields after the crops sprout. This reduces the number of weeds, allowing for higher crop yields.Though the crop plants and the bacterial gene are both products of nature (and as such cannot be copyrighted or patented), the fusion of the two is not. Monsanto created a new type of plant, and thus they have intellectual property rights to that plant. After all, the plant is just the physical manifestation of its genetic code. The parts of the code may have come from natural sources, but the finished/compiled product was made by Monsanto - at great expense. Naturally, Monsanto wants to recoup this expense, hence the contracts they sign with farmers requiring the farmers to purchase new seed every year. Those farmers can still go buy the natural seed and not be subject to the contracts; however, if they want the benefits of the Monsanto-developed seed, they have to play by Monsanto's rules.By way of analogy - you can't copyright words, but you can copyright a book made up of words. Likewise, you can't copyright natural plants, but you can copyright novel organisms created from plant genetic code.>Besides, what if this were to become a norm and then some catastrophe happens and we no longer have self-replicating plants?Splicing a terminator gene into some tomato seeds doesn't mean that all tomatoes are magically infected with the gene. In fact, because the terminator seeds produce sterile offspring, you *have* to keep a stock of normal plants in order to keep the line going.

Then we need to End the Prohibition on Cannabis, it is having the same deleterious effects of Alcohol prohibition. We just don't see it because it is mostly outside the lifespan of our current population. America didn't end when Alcohol Prohibition was repealed, nor would it end or falter when the same is done with cannabis. In fact I believe it would be strengthened because of the individual freedoms that come from ending it and the waste that would disappear from our economy.

Look at my last bullet point. But I'll explain it again properly.Assuming alcohol and tobacco are, if taken in proportionally equal and excessive quantities, more harmful than cannabis (which is questionable). Alcohol and tobacco aren't illegal because of the standard of harm they cause. The reason that we are allowed to drink isn't because we don't consider alcohol to be harmful. They are legal because of history, tradition and civil development. This fact that they are an ingrained part of our culture overrules the harm that they do. Cannabis has not been legal since 1928, and even before then its use was not even comparable to tobacco or alcohol. It therefore doesn't have the "ingrained part of our culture" counterweight to the harm that it does. So, that alcohol and tobacco may do harm than cannabis is irrelevant because the reason they are legal is nothing to do with the harm they cause.

People would buy it legally because buying it legally would be cheaper and easier to get. Do you really think a relatively easy to grow flower would still cost $20 a gram? Growing legally allows you to grow the plant on much larger areas of land allowing legal operations far out-produce the illegal ones. Also, there is a huge connoisseur culture among smokers, so there would be a niche for large scale producers of high quality cannabis.

He should go to court and talk to the DA. If he has a clean record and the DA doesn't have a particular hard-on for pot users he might be offered an ACD. If the DA doesn't offer an ACD right away, your friend should say he'd be willing to do some community service to avoid a guilty finding. Most DA's would trade a few hours' community service for an ACD in a situation like this.**He should not plead guilty or admit guilt in any way until he has this conversation with the DA,** because once he pleads guilty the DA has absolutely no incentive to offer him any kind of deal.Good luck.

I was about 15yrs old. I had a friend over and no parents home. We decided to smoke a large amount of pot in the house. So we are basically bake boxing in my room, when out my window I see my parents car coming down the road. Of course, being stoned out of my mind, my first thought is escape. I grabbed my friend and ran down to the basement. Figured we'd go out this back door down there run into woods and deal with consequences later when I'm more lucid. Unfortunately, when I went to open the door to freedom, I realized my father had nailed it shut. We were trapped. Just about that time we hear my parents come into the house, call out to see if I'm home,walk around, and debate if it's really pot smoke that they smelled or if someone had lit a skunk on fire. My friend and I stayed in the basement for about 20 min until we realized they weren't going anywhere and we had to go face the music. Proceeded to only get lectured about smoking in the house and told my friend had to go home. We left to go to his house (I think). Just remember us both leaving and remarking how surreal it was. TL;DR Filled house with illegal smoke. parents came home. hid in basement for 20 min while stoned out of mind.

It will be difficult to see most drawbacks at this stage. There hasn't been enough time for long-term drawbacks to become visible (such as, say, declining average GPAs or infertility). And some benefits (higher tax income, decreased crime rate) may be temporary or masking larger issues (decreased productivity, or reduction in crime only due to weed crimes no longer being counted).We haven't seen any **major** drawbacks (increase in violent crime, gangland warfare).

I didn't give my money to the bank.The checking account at the small chain bank that I use does not require I follow any rules. It is simply a pot that I put my money in and use as is.The bank that I use allows this because they assume they can eventually pull people into the bank if they get them comfortable with the checking system. Most large chain banks have "free checking" which is a bullshit system put in place to fuck over people. I use a small chain that has legitimately free checking. I have no minimum balance and the only things I pay for are canceling transactions (I sign a check and seek to cancel).

When you make an estimate based on a sampling poll, there's a certain percentage of error inherent. When you make an extrapolation, there's an inherent percentage of error. When you combine the two, you get a variance of roughly 100,000,000.Out of a maximum total estimate of 220,000,000. And it estimates that a possible total of 230,000,000 used drugs illegally. Basically, pretty much all people using drugs illegally (including prescription abuse) would have to use marijuana to be "hundreds of millions".

Unfortunately, no. Many companies still screen for it. I don't know if it's because it's illegal federally, or they just don't want their employees smoking weed (ever).MOST companies run a drug test if you get into an accident at work, or if you're applying for the job. It's usually a pee test too.

shipping cost of marijauna will be very small once it's legal. It's not like beer where a 100 pound keg is only worth $200. 100 pounds of pot it's worth like $350,000. Shipping is a small factor.

They're probably made of legal, prescription drugs. All you've got to do is get some fake prescriptions, or go on the black market and buy from people who already have. They're not quite "readily available", like an aspirin is readily available. They're "readily available" like pot or heroin is readily available: hard to get, dangerous to get, but there are sellers in most populated areas.

"Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time."http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/infofacts/marijuanaI will admit I'm probably pushing it with the vodka, but it still won't kill many. A fifth of vodka is about 20 shots. Vodka is like 80 proof. People who drink regularly can survive it easily. Maybe a new drinker, or someone who is light weight won't, but to say that it would kill most is by far a stretch.

You are in part correct - the burning of plant matter creates benzopyrenes and other compounds that are carcinogenic, and tobacco and cannabis both produce these. However, tobacco has many other properties that increase it's carcinogenic effects, [including the nicotine itself which can apparently exacerbate the effects](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/337tu1/aussie_gets_arrested_for_smoking_weed_in_public/cqig62n) according to links from /u/a345ju45eaj4a.

No law enforcement agency can enforce every law perfectly. All law enforcement agencies must make choices about what laws to prioritize enforcement for. That is the essence of how a politician selects a chief. Do their priorities align?Making drugs like weed a priority for enforcement over the last 30 years, for example, left a lot of other laws less enforced.

Brady used to smoke pot? Funny story...I was kicked out of detention and instead of getting mad having to redo my time i just walked outside. On my way to the parking lot, there was the detention room window. I went up to the window, pulled my pants down and moaned all the other kids in the class. When i looked back and pulled my pants up, there was the teacher...looking out the window. So I finished getting my pants back up and ran.

It seems to me that polls like this have slightly skewed data.I mean, right now, cannabis is not legal, so the number of people that use it is most likely higher than the number of people that admit to using it.That said, I am also pretty sure that once it is legal, the number of people that will use it will increase.

>Occurs in a trial when a jury acquits a defendant, even though the members of the jury believe the defendant to be guilty of the charges. This may occur when members of the jury disagree with the law the defendant has been charged with breaking, or believe that the law should not be applied in that particular case. I would imagine a pot head on the jury would not convict someone for smoking because they feel the law is wrong.

But it all comes down to what people are willing to pay. Clearly we are all willing to pay the current prices for weed. So why would distributors start charging less when they know people are willing to buy it at the currents price? It's hard for me to believe that prices will go down all that much. But once it's legalized there will be an influx in home grown operations. Almost if not more popular than homebrewing these days. But I guess that's depending on the legality of growing at home. That will probably take longer to legalize than anything.

I read somewhere that yes, pot taxes are going towards the schools, but that doesn't stop legislators from slashing funding in other places. If you get $26 million from pot taxes, that's $26 million you can cut from another source to save money. So they aren't actually putting more money into the schools, they are replacing where the money comes from.

>> No I am not. I am saying the fact that they are subjective is the justification for criticizing them.>You don't sound like the sort of person who is about to start preaching that morality is a priori, necessary, universal and absolute, so I am interpreting your use of the term "subjective" to mean that it is none of these things. I am assuming you mean 'subjective' in the popular sense. If you actually mean 'subjective morality' in the Kantian sense and are secretly some sort of deontologist then please correct me.When I say subjective I mean:"based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions."Now, I find Kantian "subjective morality" to be a very rational position. There is nothing stopping you from learning from other people's subjective experience/morals/reality/ideas. In fact, it's much easier to consider someone else's truth if you embrace the fact that truth is subjective!>So, wouldn't this criticism would have to apply equally to all moral ideas because they would all be equally 'subjective'? I would argue that trying to apply morals on a universal basis is not only foolish but impossible. Killing is wrong unless it's in self defense therefore killing is not always wrong. >If so, then you are indeed saying we can offer no specific criticism for why any specific moral idea is wrong apart from that general debunking of all moral ideas as subjective and therefore arbitrary.I am saying that any criticism MUST be specific due to the fact that reality is subjective. Either wrong is simply a feeling we all have inside us, which would make it subjective, or it's something we learn, which is also subjective.>> I don't see how this is an argument against reality being subjective.>I don't see how the fact that the perpetrators of the Holocaust would say they thought they were in the right is an argument for morality being subjective.Then I don't know if we'll ever agree. Much like Plato and Aristotle.>> Perhaps I chose two different words because I was talking about two different ideas/concepts. Let's define "morals" as "the values that have been deemed objectively good" and "values" as "the belief one holds within themselves independent of the moral majority".>"Holds within themselves" as what?I'm not sure what you are asking here. Do you not understand that my personal values might differ from the consensus morals? If you need an example, smoking marijuana. Does the fact that the majority of people think it's an immoral act make it immoral? If you believe these things are objective and universal, I'd assume you do? But that doesn't seem logical to me so maybe you don't.>> The idea that morals can be objective is what leads to homosexuality being a sin.>Certainly true.>Are you saying this makes objective morality bad?I am saying that it cannot exist. Are you going to say objective morality is objectively good? >> It's what leads to prohibition.>Again, this is true, but are you saying that this makes objective morality bad?Again. If objective morality isn't objectively good, what good is it, objectively?>> The idea that morals/ideas/reality are subjective leads us to discovering things such as evolution and science.>Are you saying this makes subjective morality good?I am saying it makes it subjective. Good and bad are subjective values.>>> Are you saying that makes moral absolutism bad?>> Yes. That is exactly what I am saying.>Absolutely bad?Only the Sith deal in absolutes.>> Anyone who thinks they know all the answers is a fool.>You have said it.I wasn't the first.The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.>> Telling someone that murder is objectively wrong will not stop them from doing it.>Certainly true.>Are you saying this makes objective morality bad?I can't handle all these value statements in a debate whether reality is subjective. What point are you trying to make by asking subjective questions? Whether I think it is good or bad, is entirely subjective!>> Because "God says so" seems to have worked for some in the past.>"Worked" to do what? To prevent murder? Why prevent murder?I wouldn't like to be murdered.>> Do you have a better one?>I don't see how there could be such a thing as "better" apart from some standard of better and worse.Which could be subjectively agreed upon...Not gonna lie, I'm an atheist and even I'm starting to understand why religion exists.>(later edit) In defending the idea of moral realism (to the extent that it can be defended -- constructing arguments in favor of it may involve relying upon it as a hidden premise, which may invalidate such arguments) I would be defending the idea that it is possible for me to be wrong about ethics. If morals are all feels no reals, then my current view would always be right by definition, since morality would be by definition only what my own opinion says it is. Being wrong would mean that my opinion doesn't match the reality. If there is no reality apart from my opinion then my opinion can never be wrong. Only if my opinions on morality are really about something is it possible for there to be a mismatch between my opinions and the something. If they aren't about anything other than my own opinions then there can never be such a mismatch and I can never be wrong.I don't see it like that. You seem to have this idea that people cannot be influenced and that minds cannot be changed. As if calling something subjective means it's objectively and infinitely true to the individual. As if it being subjective means it cannot ever be wrong. When that's exactly what I think when you say something is objective.>And about "knowing all the answers" -- he who says that there are no answers is saying that there are no answers which he does not know.It's all or nothing right? That would explain why you have a hard time internalizing the possibility that reality is subjective. At this point I would like to know what you have anchored yourself in.

ATTENTION ALL REDDITORS: If you are charged with misdemeanor pot possession in Cook County know that the prosecutors will NOT be able to prove their case in court. They never force the chemists to come to court on misdemeanor pot cases because they are too busy. So, as long as you plead NOT GUILTY and refuse to STIPULATE to the laboratory tests, the states attorneys will dismiss the case. They will attempt to get you to plead guilty for drug school or some BS but don't. JUST PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND RUN.

The Elections Commission has been notorious for decades about discriminating against volunteer signature gathers. They create artificial penalties like reviewing just 10 pages out of 100 pages of signatures submitted, then saying that on 5 pages of 10 that too many signatures are illegible, so they reject 50 of your signature pages out of the 100 submitted. They don't need 112,200 signatures, they need at least 180,000 signatures. This was one way that recreational marijuana was kept off the ballot for so long.

I know I'm really late to this, but I surprisingly really enjoyed this audio book. It certainly did have flaws, however you ended up mentioning any that I noticed in your podcast.Here's a few random thoughts: part 1 wasn't as bad as you made it out to be. There were definitely a few cringey moments, but I don't think they were as bad as you made it out to be.Part 2 I actually really liked. While Rebecca was meant to be a normal girl, I don't think that necessarily made her boring. And a large part of that was due to her relationship with Joe. I think your dialogue was really strong here, and it actually made me care about both of the characters. Their flirting was actually pretty cute. It was weird how they stayed the night and just made out though. Also, the weed scene was fucking hilarious. Listening to that made me just start crying due to laughing so hard.Part 3 was without a doubt the best part though. Despite the stupid name, I found Onii-chan a really cool character, and I loved his relationship with Sarah. While her expository dialogue may have been out of character, it was at least interesting to listen to and reminded me a lot of Kaiki's thoughts on fakes in the Monogatari series. (On second thought, it may be more like Oshino's, but oh well.) The conclusion was also incredibly depressing and made me legitimately sad for Onii-chan and Nine.Part 4 was pretty good. I actually really liked getting to see more of Joe, and getting into his mind was really fascinating. The tone may have been a bit over the place, however I wouldn't call it incomprehensible. The scene with Levi was incredibly enjoyable, and I loved every scene he was in. While the ending was incredibly quick, I didn't mind that it ended in a happy ending. I'm a bit of a sucker for stories that end that way anyways.In conclusion, the story definitely wasn't bad. I enjoyed listening to all of that, and you got me invested enough that I definitely would have listened to the sequels. While I wouldn't say it's the best thing I've ever read, I've done a lot of reading in my time, it was certainly a hell of a lot better than the worst I've read. I'd say it was slightly above average. Your prose, dialogue, themes, and character writing were all really enjoyable and I would definitely like to see more from you in the future.

I see this claim made about the supremacy clause again and again and it's always false. The supremacy clause does not give the federal government power. The rest of the constitution does. Large parts of the constitution list what the federal government CAN make and enforce laws about, and it says that is the power not *explicitly listed* is not given. The bill of rights explicitly list things the federal government *can't* make laws about. The supremacy clause says that *in those areas where the constitution says the federal government can make law* that those laws shall be the supreme law of the land. It in no way invalidates the *constitutional limitation of powers.* The issue here is not *is a federal law about pot the supreme law of the land* but rather *does the federal government have any right to make laws about pot in the first place.*

You can beat fiora lvl 1. Depends what she starts, q or w. If she starts q you need to play reactively and if she starts W you need to play proactively. So stay in your minion wave in case she starts Q so she will take minion damage. If she double Qs you, immediately go aggro af, jump on her, q her, etc. She just wasted her CD. Common mistake is being afraid after she chunks you lvl 1. Your Q is on a 6s CD, her Q is on 16s CD. If she starts W, however, she will basically wait for you to jump on her and try to parry your Q. You will lose if she does so. To beat this, you jump on her, *don't q her*, just run back to your minions. Usually they will use w, just wait until its over (1.5s), then jump on her. Alternatively, you can just not jump on her at all and get ferocity stacks on the wave for free, since if she starts w she can't do anything to you, then all in her at lvl 2.This is all assuming they play predictably though. Good fioras know exactly what you're expecting them to do and they will do stuff to combat this. They might q on you then q to a minion then run away or something. Just in general punish her high CDs early. It will be nice to get a kill early, but she will still be able to 1v1 you lvl 6 even if shes 0-1. Exhaust is a good option.Pantheon seems strong lvl 1 but hes not. If you two are just standing on top of each other autoing, and using spells you will win. His damage is not bursty. It is poke poke poke poke poke kill. Pretty much just try to all in him before the wave comes or right as it comes, before he can auto minions for his passive. Just make sure to pot up early as he will probably just fight you and not run away. If he does have his passive, jump on him to get rid of it, then use q. Sit in brush so he can't throw Q's at you. He will undoubtedly push lane so an early gank can fk him. If you can, stand near a cannon minion when he goes on you so it pops his passive. Like fiora, a first blood will not guarantee an easy lane. If you ever use empowered Q on him or even normal Q on his shield it can fk you hard.These cheese strats are called cheese strats because it does not work all the time. If they know about it, they can just play defensive and kill you later. That's why a lot of people suggest going ninja tabis and maxing W, that's the "safe" way. But I would never do that.Riven is a similar thing. A lot of rivens will want to q you lvl 1. Once you see her use Q, just keep backing up to the brush, try to make her use her q's for gap closing so they end up hitting only one or 2 q's on you. At this point you can just keep jumping on her and qing her. Panth and fiora lvl 1 fights are not guaranteed kills but riven ones are pretty guaranteed if you can get her to use all 3 Q's towards you. If they're smart they will use the last q away from you and run, but even then, they might be dead. Still, riven is like fiora, she will be a pain throughout the game, especially once she hits 6. even if shes 0/2 if you misplay at lvl 6, she could easily kill you.

I have been quite lucky and don't get malz banned or picked from me often. So posting my op.gg won't help that much as I haven't played it recently :P. Accounts are Srheer0 / Takanori77 / ralzamar (euw) if you want to look.Basically you can take deathfire or thunderlords, start either corrupting pot or dorans ring. Look to poke the enemy with your E and walk away. You can either push hard by hitting them and the wave, or put it behind the wave and try to just hit them. Buildwise you want CDR, AP and Pen. Morellos first is recommended as I feel lost chapter is better than tear. Lucidity or Sorc boots depending on if you have CDR blues in your runes. Get Liandries and maybe protobelt, then situational depending on how well you are doing. Skillwise you can choose to max W or Q second. W gives more attack speed and move speed slow, so I prefer it against most mid matches because most are ranged and can kite your Q range. An added bonus is your ult has an AP scaling % hp burn. Ignore what your team say about reporting you, as long as you do well they shouldn't. At rank 3, your E pushes the wave very easily, you just need to manage your mana in lane and try to use your lifesteal to heal up if u take a bad trade

Definitely. Here it's legal, and I think it's actually made it harder to get weed underage (similar to how when weed was illegal it was really hard to get alcohol underage compared to weed). If you're under 21 and want weed you have to find an illegal dealer who hasn't been put out of business by legal stores (hard) or get someone to buy it for you. Not as easy as finding the local dealer who was really easy to find.

Their beliefs trigger the panic attack. The weed did not do it.Someone with panic attacks may need to assess what substances they consume. That is not an admonishment of cannabis. An encounter with law enforcement could trigger a panic attack, is it as dangerous as cannabis?Sometimes people who are predisposed to panic attacks have panic attacks while doing other things. The other things were just a catalyst, they don't "cause" panic attacks, the person had a panic attack and it was involved. It may seem like semantics, but it is an important distinction. A contributing factor is not the same thing as the cause.

Effects on the HeartMarijuana increases heart rate by 20-100 percent shortly after smoking; this effect can last up to 3 hours. In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.5 This may be due to increased heart rate as well as the effects of marijuana on heart rhythms, causing palpitations and arrhythmias. This risk may be greater in aging populations or in those with cardiac vulnerabilities.Effects on the LungsNumerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.8 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.

From before I was born to the point I was 3 my mother and father were not exactly "happily married". My mother would often leave me with people my father didn't even know at drug dens while she got her fix (She was addicted to marijuana and cocaine). She spent all my father's money, wrecked his truck while DUI and many other things. My father finally filed for a divorce and when the custody battle came up even my mother's side of the family was supportive of my father winning custody. However, my father talked to a judge (Not the only overseeing his case) and the judge said that despite all the evidence that she is an unfit mother the judge is still very likely to give her custody due to her being the mother. This terrified my father and he sought to hire the best lawyer in Tennessee, I forget his name, but this was in the early 90s and he was a real big player. The bill was so large that my father had to ask the family for help, and my uncle gave my father the money he had been saving to build a house so that my father could afford the lawyer.My father got the lawyer and prepared as best he could to win custody over me. When the court date came up everyone was there in anticipation, and my mother never even showed up, and my father was given custody.I lucked out, but it's a shame to see children given to the lesser choice as a parent just because of the fact it is their mother. If the father is more fit to care for the child then they should be granted custody. I agree that kids should have both parents, but I don't believe it really matters in the end which parent raises them if there is only one. There's plenty of people who turn out to have great lives with only one parent, be it a mother or a father, myself included.

I’m not saying that i agree or disagree with what I’m about to post but here ya go,Wrong. The law that applies to situations where state and federal laws disagree is called the supremacy clause, which is part of article VI of the Constitution. The supremacy clause contains what’s known as the doctrine of pre-emption, which says that the federal government wins in the case of conflicting legislation. Basically, if a federal and state law contradict, then when you’re in the state you can follow the state law, but the feds can decide to stop you. When there is a conflict between a state law and federal law, it is the federal law that prevails. For example, if a federal regulation prohibits the use of medical marijuana, but a state regulation allows it, the federal law prevails.https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_4676579

That is because cocaine is addictive. I think the Dutch model is best: classify drugs as either soft(marijuana) or hard drugs(cocaine, heroin, crack, etc). Legalize soft drugs, make hard drugs illegal/controlled. Also, when soft drugs are illegal, people go to a dealer for pot and the dealer cross sells cocaine and other addictive drugs, legalizing soft drugs stops the gateway effect.

You don't understand. The weed that is grown indoors can't be grown naturally in the outdoors. It's cloned, it has no seeds. It will always be in demand. If anything, growhouses would be too small to be competitive, and growers would have to invest in large warehouses. The reason would be because so many people would start growing, the market would be flooded, and growers will start lowering the price as much as they can till they are making minimum profit and covering their overhead. People growing right now illegally out of houses would be quickly put out of business by people with enough start up money to go straight into a large warehouse. A warehouse would be able to produce much more than a house. I really don't know how the monthly costs of the house might compare to the monthly overhead of a warehouse, but they are probably not too far apart. But then the warehouse probably produces at least twice the output of the house, meaning they can reduce the cost they sell at until no one is willing to buy from the guy growing out of his house, because if the home grower tries to match the warehouse price, he makes no profit, and can't pay his own bills.

You said cannabis is a "gateway drug" i.e it leads people to use harder drugs.The evidence shows that legalizing cannabis decreases hard drug use and therefore it isn't a 'gateway drug'. It is possibly a gateway to hard drugs via illegal drug dealers, but cannabis itself isn't a "gateway drug" like you said. If you a pro-legalization, stop saying its a gateway drug because it isn't...

There's a difference between burning yourself and what McDonalds did, McDonalds know that the coffee could burn people, but didn't want to reduce the temperature.>During discovery, McDonalds produced documents showing more than 700 claims by people burned by its coffee between 1982 and 1992. Some claims involved third-degree burns substantially similar to Liebecks. This history documented McDonalds' knowledge about the extent and nature of this hazard. > McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.>Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. **The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.**

Yeah, the biggest upside is that local police won't be going after marijuana users and the feds can't conscript them into enforcing drug laws. If the feds want to enforce these laws, their going to do it on their own dime, which will be a deterrent to fully enforcing the drug laws on the local level.

The illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world.Carl Sagan

"In two studies with reasonable numbers of individuals who had only used cannabis, there was no clear evidence of increased culpability in these drivers." - The Lancet"No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis" - Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute"Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving" - Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs"The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08" - U.S. Department of Transportation Study

Because alcohol is far more harmful? Yeah I'd agree with that. Although for arguing against people who think alcohol should be legal but cannabis shouldn't - comparing them is useful because it knocks down virtually any health based argument they have.

>but there's definitely people who are serving prison sentences or on trial for marijuana-related crimes who would be released or have their sentences reduced as a result of legalization.No. Unless it's somehow retroactive, it was a crime when they committed their offenses. Therefore, their sentences for those crimes will stand.

Is pot bad or not? Not is "smoking" pot bad.... Pot itself... The law is about pot, not about how you ingest it. Is pot bad? Should it be illegal or not? The law has nothing to say about how you ingest it, just if the substance is bad or not. It doesn't seem to be.

Because the trim pot had been adjusted wrong. The diodes are nonlinear so current flowing through them will make the system nonlinear. The idea is that you adjust the resistors so that only the tiniest amount of current has to go through the diodes to regulate amplitude.

Marijuana stocks. With the recent legalization in Washington and Colorado the stocks revolving around marijuana have been going nuts (extremely volatile, + or - 10% in a trading day). Most of them are penny stocks (MJNA, PHOT). I still havent done any trading in the MJ arena.

The funny thing is prohibition of alcohol led to the creation of organized crime. The organized crime we know today are called drug cartels. With the end of prohibition of drugs, such as marijuana, cartel activity would decrease in the same way it did once alcohol prohibition ended. Sure it'll still be there, it always will be, but there will be less activity.

Hm strange. I am running 21/9/0 while taking butcher and feast and no attack speed in offense. For runes I run AD quints, Arpen marks, Armor seals, 6x CDR glyphs and 3x MRes glyphs. I will do Krugs with some help from botlaners (smiting the big one the second it spawns), go to red (pop a pot), here i'll go a bit low. Head to blue (regen while burrowed). On blue ill have smite ready and pop my second pot. Maybe 75% is a bit overexagerated, but it should be atleast 65% health (+regen after blue) and I can gank top. I will burrow twice on big camps usually. Watching for the knockup-timer, burrowing right after an AA when it nearly times out only to get a burrowed Q out and another knockup (not quite sure how efficient this is, but I think it saves me some damage while also only missing out ~1,5AAs (but getting the burrowed Q damage).

I more or less interpreted from Valve that they were just trying to encourage TNC to kick Kuku to kill the drama, so they "sweetened the pot" by saying no penalty if that's the case.Then they didn't bite and kept prolonging the drama, which resulted in today's action.

I guess. I don't know your local police like you do. Enforcement of marijuana laws by local police is incentivized by federal funding. They get money from the Feds for each arrest. So if the money isn't there from the Feds... It likely depends on local civil asset forfeiture laws

I know.. it was a typo. I had previous marijuana convictions from about 4years ago. The court appointed attorney told me that they would bring my past history up and it wouldn't matter if I fought it. The D.A wouldn't listen to traffic incident or at least this is what my attorney told me. I then asked the judge if he could give me a continuance to hire a lawyer and he refused it. So not knowing what to do I just took the plea deal.

Please do your research before perpetuating a completely false understanding of that court case.In the McDonald's burn case, they were serving coffee at between *180-190 degrees Fahrenheit.* For comparison, coffee brewed in a pot at home is *135 degrees.* It was *dangerously hot*, and they had been warned multiple times that the coffee was *dangerously hot.*[Here is a NSFW photo of the *third degree burns* on the woman's legs.](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e37dbe8e2214d51e27018d686f7cb8da-c) She almost *died.*And the kicker? *She only sued McDonald's for the cost of her medical bills.* **They fought it.

Except most Republicans have no idea what policies they are supporting when they blindly vote for the R on the ballot. Case in point: the same night that a bunch of Republicans got voted into office, the voters also chose to raise state minimum wages, legalize pot, pass environmental regulations and vote down anti-abortion measures.Time and again its been shown that progressive/Democratic policies are more popular (usually *much* more popular) than Republican policies. Yet voters choose to vote for the party that supports policies that they don't like.

>You seem to think that even discussing gun restrictions at all as an option is "aggressively pushing for gun control". It's hysterical.....There you go again assuming that someone needs to have a solution in hand before the problem solving can begin.**You did not point out which side of the research is restricted at all**. The three links I gave you shows it has both sides on the argument, unless you willfully choose to ignore them simply because it doesn't fit in your talking point. I said because since you don't have a solution and the fact you said that rights needs to be sacrificed according to you which isn't going to actually lead us anymore good for both sides is exactly the same thing. It's the same thing is saying we need to ban certain firearms. Your statement is good in ideal, but as far as the long-term practices in the long run, it's unlikely going to work. Saying so doesn't mean you have an actual solution on end. That's my point. We already have a solution, it's called the Gun Control Act. We don't need any more emotional-based laws that isn't going to work.>No, I said "well hello there pot", alluding to "the pot calling the kettle black". You really need to work on your reading comprehension, because you're embarrassing yourself.Ad-hominem attacks, making a logical fallacy, and trying to make a statement in a hostile manner in what is perceived to be truly false. Exactly what you did and your recent comments. How about give up before you embarrass yourself anymore because you're picking on words and words each and everytime, whereas I pick on your arguments.

You bastard. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas... I’ll bet you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a dick than be seen with you.You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space.

Effects on the HeartMarijuana increases heart rate by 20-100 percent shortly after smoking; this effect can last up to 3 hours. In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.5 This may be due to increased heart rate as well as the effects of marijuana on heart rhythms, causing palpitations and arrhythmias. This risk may be greater in aging populations or in those with cardiac vulnerabilities.Effects on the LungsNumerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.8 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.

Anyone else find it interesting that one of the cities is one where weed is legal. What is something high people want to go do, see movies. Might work. Also I can see them showing weekly TV shows or serials of some sort. It'd be cool to have a weekly show you go watch with a full audience.

Its currently so expensive because its illegal, dealers can charge what they want because where else are you going to get it? Part of the price is the risk growers/sellers take. Its really not a difficult plant to grow, granted high quality strains take a bit more care but its just an herb that most would be able to grow a little in their garden no problem.

You don't know what you are talking about.With alcohol, you actually have to be drunk when you show up to be punished. Of course showing up to work drunk = being fired.With weed, if you did it any time in the last few months outside of work legally, they still fire you. Which makes no sense. The test doesn't test that you came to work high.Obviously coming to work high should mean you are fired the same as coming to work drunk.

To narrow the argument a little: Prohibition has always been a complete failure. It doesn't lower addiction rates, it creates cartels/gangs, and it makes criminals out of the common man. We repealed alcohol prohibition in the 1930's and we are repealing cannabis prohibition now.Holding onto failed practices is not a good move.

You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As we say in Texas. I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselfs in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you ckoke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.the only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of your of whay you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

Petroleum based plastics! Everything that is made out of plastic today could be made from bio-degradable hemp based plastic instead. Paper could come from hemp instead of trees. For God's sake - legalize MJ and start our tobacco farmers growing industrial hemp!!

Remember news just sells to there buyers. Fox news watchers generally are old, conservative and don't pot to be legal. So what does Fox News sell? Pot is evil.I am more surprised, that people are surprised by this.MSNBC and Fox news both do it and have my entire adult life.

Weed isn't a culture. It is a plant and substance. How shitty is your terrible life that you have to connect with people over weed?Meth users don't lie about why they would support meth legalization or pretend that using meth makes them better than other people or talk about fucking meth all day and make shitty pseudonyms about meth. No "methpartofwakingup" or "heavy-methal" on reddit.

First off,she was parked,secondly the manager took out the safety devices in the coffee machine that keeps coffee at 180-190 degrees Fahrenheit. I worked at a diner and had a freshly brewed pot if coffee explode on me. It gave my stomach 1st and 2nd degree burns. Not bad at all,I got some burn cream and was good. No visible scars,google this ladies burn and you'll see what she was totally in the right to sue.

A few weeks ago I had one of the weirdest dreams I have had in a while. I was riding in a small sedan on the highway with a friend of mine. We were smoking a joint while riding down the road. As I look in the rear view mirror I see blue lights turn on. My friend pulled the car over and put it in park. We sat there for a minute waiting for the two police officers that were in the cruiser to walk up to our window. As they walk up, the one officer shines his flash light in my face and tells me to get out of the car. I opened the door and step out of the vehicle. As I look into the face of the officer I realize its Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney proceeds to inform me that I was being arrested for possession of marijuana. He then puts handcuffs on me and puts me in the back of the cruiser. After this dream I woke up feeling extremely disturbed.

List of subreddits suddenly going private**Be back to update in a couple hours.**"Suddenly" was how it seemed when a bunch of main subreddits were locked, but now the locks are coming in a cascade.

We spend something in the region of $200m per year on cannabis enforcement. A prisoner costs the state roughly $100k per year. So straight up on your comment we could be saving around $215m a year. This is about half of Bill's "surplus"

>Effects on the Lungs>Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer; however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers. Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.>Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers. Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses. [source](http://drugabuse.gov/infofacts/marijuana.html)TL;DR - you're sort of right, but there are other things to consider.

I think we took a wrong turn somewhere. You said:>Well being for slavery, as I interpreted it, would mean being for legal slavery.I interpreted that as "people who would be for slavery, which is illegal, would like to make it legal." That's why I mentioned marijuana. It is illegal, and people that are for it want to make it legal. Same with sex trafficking -- anyone who's for it would probably rather not get arrested for it.

Harry J. Anslinger quotes: ...the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.​Harry J. Anslinger quotes: There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.​Harry J. Anslinger quotes: Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men.​

I'm not saying there do not exist negative side effects, just that there have not been any conclusive studies done by non-biased sources that prove there are any negative effects on your health. It just happens to be the case that many people believe in nonexistant side effects that have no tested basis, and were made up by the media and big businesses to keep weed from being legalized.

How is there an illegal market anyway? If owning weed is legal, then surely buying it from a dealer must be legal too? or is the act of buying it legal, but selling it is illegal? So if a cop bought you buying weed, only the dealer would get shit?

I NEVER take TDL into Jax because I personally think Fervor is wayyy better then any other mastery on riven atm. Against Jax I start D shield/D blade and pot. I take Q level 1 and farm until level 3 and let him push. Then I go for fast trades. You can mix your combos for trades depends is he using abilities to farm, for example: Q - AA - W then E back or If he uses his E I wait for my cooldowns and go for really long trade and here is where is fervor better. Just count his E cdr, its pretty long, so you can know when he gets it back. The matchup is similiar to Darius one but this one is easier, less punishable. At level 6 just chunk him with fast trades, if he uses E, again, wait for cooldowns go all in and he is dead. But keep in mind that he can jump with his Q so try to hold your R2 or make some animation cancel like R - Q so you can hit it.

What country do you live in? I know plenty of fathers that would have been willing to do so prior to birth because of the terrible relationship status they had with the mother (or in several cases, the mother's parents). In one instance, the father or the child hasn't been allowed to even see his child since birth due to a court order obtained by the mother's father -- yet he has still had to pay support for the past seven years now despite never once seeing the child in person. And no, it wasn't due to abuse but a misdemeanor marijuana possession citation in high school.

I agree. They couldn't call it a "credit union" because that term is defined to include federal insurance. But they could form a financial services provider that mirrors all the aspects of a credit union.Nothing would have made the industry more legitimate and more secure at its inception than a CO state-run financial services provider... insuring deposits, offering business loans, etc. The option to create one should have been included in the marijuana omnibus package, but regulators opted to grandstand over the minutiae of personal use instead.

The problem I see with that is the fact that there are some legitimate medical uses that have NOTHING to do with recreational use. There are several strains that have virtually none of the compounds that get you high, but are extremely effective at reducing anxiety, treating seizure disorders, etc.It seems ridiculous to punish patients who could actually benefit from the medicinal properties of marijuana by refusing to decouple recreational use from legitimate medical uses.

Marijuana smoke contains carcinogenic hydrocarbons; 2. Cannabinoid administration promotes cancer under certain laboratory conditions; 3. Lesions similar to those caused by tobacco smoke are found in the bronchial epithelium of marijuana smokers; 4. Marijuana tar produces tumors when painted on the skin of animals. The best evidence to date on the link between marijuana and cancer, however, derives from large case-control studies -- especially population-based studies. Such studies tend to suggest, if anything, an inverse association between marijuana use and cancers.Source : http://www.marijuana.com/Shall we continue?

No. This was His plan all along, to make a people for Himself and to do so in the most profound display of love in His created world, death on behalf of loved ones. If God IS love, it makes sense that He would have the greatest showing. Your logic is off. If there is a God it is foolish for you to even begin to question the Creator. (Romans 9, does the pot say to the potter "Why have you made me this way?") When you read a good story like 'The Lord of the Rings', are you asking… "why didn't Tolkien just start the book of with them at Mount Doom? Why did they have to go through all of that suffering? Why did he choose a Hobbit and not a warrior? That's ridiculous!" No. The author has the right to tell his story how he sees fit. In the same way God is the author of THE story and this is how He chose to write it. He also explains in His Word that people who have not been "born again" spiritually (only possible by an act of His grace) will think His plan is "ridiculous" (see verse below). This was God's plan all along. We didn't thwart an original plan and we didn't surprise Him. He doesn't a parallel adversary. He is Sovereign King over the universe, the beginning and the end. The Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians 1:17-31"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”[c]20 Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand signs and Greeks *(everyone else)* look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.26 Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him. 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”*italics mine

Watch it happen now. Weed Should be illegal and remain illegal. If you dont smoke weed you dont have to worry about going to prison. You do have a choice, dont murder someone, dont smoke weed, dont do drugs, dont drink while driving, dont steal, and dont worry about the law or do it and worry about the law. The choice is yours.

I wasn't trying to debate that. My original comment was just an analysis of the facts presented in that the first article you linked. You quoted OP:>to say underground sales will flourish is clearly lacking any basis of facts.but the article you linked didn't prove that *underground sales* flourished, it said legally sold marijuana was being diverted out of state. I'm not trying to suggest I have a factual basis for saying the tax rate wouldn't affect black market sales, I just read the first article you posted and commented on it specifically.I can absolutely believe that a high tax rate allowed the black market to flourish, it seems very intuitive. I was just pointing out that the first article wasn't actually about that.

The Supreme Court holds that the 10th Amendment states a truism and adds nothing in and of itself to the Constitution. The Supremacy Clause of Article 6 of the Constitution establishes Federal Law as "the supreme law of the land." Where federal and state laws are in conflict, Federal law takes precedence where the federal government had acted within the scope of its powers. Federal law trumps state law in areas where the federal government has the power to legislate, this being one of them. The Supreme Court has rarely held anything unconstitutional on 10th amendment grounds, one of he only exceptions being where the federal government has attempted to compel the states to enforce federal statutes. This is important here because the federal government cannot force, say the Denver Police Department, to enforce federal marijuana laws. Marijuana remains illegal federally in all states, however the federal government must use its own agencies to enforce those laws, which it has been unwilling to do under this administration, but could easily do under another.

I think they should try it. The Flyers need more than one line that can score, and they *need* Lecavalier to produce more than he did last season. Putting our second best playmaker on the team on a line with Lecavalier should help both issues.Also, we can get production out of Schenn by putting him with Giroux. Simmonds can win the board battles on that line and crash the net and pot a few ES goals himself. Third line will dominate opposing teams' top lines. Fourth line can hold its own against most lines as well. I expect more offense out of the fourth line this season.

"Alcohol or drugs" is a common colloquialism. The purpose of it is to distinguish between Alcohol use (which is a drug but legal) and *illegal* drug use (amphetamines, cocaine, heroine, pharmaceuticals, and in some cases marijuana).The phrase isn't used to distinguish alcohol as not being a drug.

Somewhat psychedelic-esque, maybe... but in comparison to an actual psychedelic trip (like 200ug+ of LSD) or (4 grams+ of mushrooms); it's completely different.

>Effects on the Lungs>Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;8 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.9 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.>Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.10 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.From: http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/marijuana.htmlTL;DR: It has carcinogens, but hasn't been directly linked to cancer. However, it can still lead to lung illnesses. So, you're right in that it hasn't been proven to directly cause cancer, but it's hardly harmless to your body.

I lost all of my high school friends about 2 months before graduation. The entire group I hung out with collectively decided to not want me around any more and just cut me off. I met them at my local high school which I got expelled from because I gave away a gram of weed to a friend who got caught and told on me. We still remained friends when I moved away to a military boarding school, but we still hung out on the weekends until they ditched me. It depressed me so much that I couldn't maintain friendships at military school. Ironically, I got expelled from THAT school for smoking cigarettes (my 3rd offense), and finished off my last 2 months of school back at a local alternative school, where I met no one. To this day, I have no lasting friendships from anyone I went to any high school with. Not even a week ago I got slightly "depressed" over something (on vacation of all places) and was reminded of the whole high school thing again. Happens every time, and it never fails to make things worse.

It takes more than a pot to make it VV. It's just an adjustable resistor so it can lower the voltage but not raise it. Also it lowers voltage by dissipating the extra voltage as heat. Putting a couple watts through it would make it very hot and also waste battery life.To do VV you really need a switched-mode voltage regulator chip like a buck converter or a buck-boost converter. You could use a pot to control the output voltage.

Watering easy, do it when the plant tells you to! However, it is not possible for us to tell you how much or how often to water, as it depends on a number of variables, including plant size, air temp, soil temp, and humidity. Basic rule of thumb: stick your finger 2 inches down into the soil, about 1/2 way between the plant and the edge of the pot. If it is dry, it needs water. If it is damp, it doesn't. Make sure that it needs watering before you water it, and when you do, give it enough water so that it begins to drain into the drip tray.The pH of the water is not as important as the pH of the soil. Water pH only serves to regulate the pH of the soil, so keep an eye on soil pH to know if you should adjust your water up or down.

I think the main points that set apart Vlad and Ryze lategame is their teamfighting. I feel like Vlad teamfights better then Ryze - but that's just my own opinion. With Vlad, in a teamfight you should easily be able to ult at least 2 people - one of them being part of the backline. Ie with ghost, you can rush in, ult, e + q one of their carries and pool/zonyas. By doing this, you alone are zoning their entire backline because they can't step past you without instantly dying to you once pool/zonyas wears off. At this point their bruisers will usually Peel off and start focusing you. After your invuln wears off, do e + q again and go into your second invuln (ie if you used pool the first time, zonyas the second time and vice versa). All the while your team's damage is amplified by your ult. If you are high enough on health for a third rotation of e + q in the teamfight, you're basically God. If you can't, ie you get bursted right after your second invuln, that's fine too - you've done your job by then. With Ryze, he has more single target damage, but the damage is also more spammable. He has an okay amount of aoe but its nothing to write home about. He also has a much higher skillcap (LOL) because as Ryze you also have to know what combos will do the greatest amount of damage, etc. I saw a video by imls (d1 Korean Ryze main) and he explained Ryze combos, and it was a lot to keep in mind. Ryze also ends up being considerably tanky, just like Vlad (ie Ryze has FH/Iceborn guantlet to Vlad's Hourglass; similar armor values). Also, because Ryze does not have invulns, he's also more susceptible to being focused and killed because he's usually also in the front lines. But his seraphs shield kind of makes up for that.Early game, Ryze is a much better laner then Vlad because he does so much damage with a mana crystal start. His abilities are also more spammable, so Ryze is a big bully up top. Vlad can get beat up by the likes of Renekton/Riven/Ryze early on and isn't really able to duel with them until you get a few points into your q. At the same time, Ryze doesn't really have any escapes besides trying to rune prison someone and running, whereas Vlad has his pool to escape dangerous situations.Mid game, I'd say Ryze and Vlad's teamfighting are about the same. The reason being Vlad is really cdr dependent (mid game you should have 30-40% Cdr with cdr boots, wota and blue pot + masteries) - but at that point he doesn't have as much tankiness as Ryze, who should have like a stacked RoA, FH, and a seraph's/spirit visage).Throughout the game, Ryze will also offer more in skirmishes (1v1, 2v2, 3v3s because his damage is much more rapid, whereas with Vlad you have to take more time to get multiple rotations of your spells off.Let me know if you have any questions about what I wrote :)

> a lady spills hot coffee on herself in a drive through, gets burned, sues Mcdonalds because they did not tell her the coffee was supposed to be hotI think you will find the facts about the infamous McDonald's coffee case rather interesting:McDonalds coffee was not only hot, it was scalding -- capable of almost instantaneous destruction of skin, flesh and muscle. - McDonald's actively enforced a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. Liquids at 180 degrees will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds.- McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was *not fit for consumption* because it would burn the mouth and throat. - The company admitted its customers were unaware that they could suffer third degree burns from the coffee and that a statement on the side of the cup was not a "warning" but a "reminder".. - McDonalds own research showed that customers intend to consume the coffee immediately while driving. Still, Mrs. Liebeck was parked.- A vascular surgeon determined that Mrs. Liebeck suffered full thickness burns (or third-degree burns) over **6 percent** of her bodyhttp://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm

Melatonin is released endogenously by your body to induce sleep, as well as help regulate it. I'm not aware of any studies to back back it up, but it seems to make sense that since it is known that cannabis alters your sleep cycles, melatonin would help counter this. It's definitely worth a try.I will say though, if you're not too familiar with it, take it immediately before you go to bed. I say this because if you take it, and then power through the drowsiness, it actually makes it much harder to fall asleep for me. Also, I'd suggest taking it on a night where you won't have to wake up early the next morning. I personally find that if I take it and then wake up before getting enough sleep (generally around 8-9 hours) that I feel drowsy throughout most of the day. But with that being said, it is a very helpful compound in that it gives you very restful sleep.

People aren't going to stop smoking cigarettes when weed is legal. Just because someone smokes cigarettes doesn't mean they smoke weed too. I also assume there will be a weed ban in public places anyway.

i see what your saying but my dad told me yo can smoke if you want to not my house go find somewhere else to live, but at the same time he smokes weed and has a medical card. He is just looking out for me because if i get caught once with the law i will be fucked for the rest of my life, which is what happened to him. i agree with him so i will wait, and i got caught i think four times, one of the times it was with my friend and my dad asked who's shit it was i said it was mine thinking my friend would take part of the blame even though it was all his, he said he dos not do that stuff and threw me under the bus.

Narcotics are a class of drug mainly used to describe drugs that use opium as a derivative (i.e. heroin, morphine). However cannabis for some reason is technically a narcotic... I think after legalization it will no longer be classified as such.

I am not 'saying' anything, I'm repeating the law. Refusing a search is not an admission of guilt, and it is certainly not grounds to give an officer lawful reasonable cause.If the officer says that your refusal of a search gives him reasonable cause, and that he's going to search anyways, he is violating your rights.There are exceptions, such as the 'plain sight' rule, which basically refers to the officer being able to see anything in 'plain sight' within the vehicle through the windows, or smelling marijuana as he approaches the vehicle.Regardless of the situation, you should always refuse a search. The officer will go on about how 'you have something to hide,' and will say all sorts of things in an attempt to intimidate you into saying something.If he has a warrant, and has legal authority to search the car, he won't ask permission, he'll just search, he won't ask.

I presented specifics that the government is using as their base data, those replying are claiming it irrelevant while attacking the messenger. They didn't reply to what is presented in the article, they ignored the exact specifics from the article that I then laid out in detail and cited. Address the specifics or don't, using adhomenim arguments and attacks does not change those specifics or the fact that the government objectives are being regulated for based on those specifics. Those specifics are in a report written with the guidance of multiple LPs. Claiming them to be garbage as some have means they are claiming the LPs are contributing to that garbage.Downvoting citations after asking for them while resorting to hyperbole and insinuations is not them attempting to reply or communicate. LP's are making more money off of hype believing specific dismissing traders like those I am replying to than they are from weed sales.

He's continued Bush's war legacy. The US is now in more wars today than it was when Obama took office. Obama even tried to keep troops in Iraq past Bush's withdraw date.Obama also cracked down on medicinal marijuana despite promising not to. Obama also enacted a tax hike on the middle class despite promising not to.Obama continued Bush's bank bailouts, and refused to prosecute any bankers for the mess they created. Even Corzine is off the hook! It is truly a tragedy.

No. What you're saying is taking a general term, like "criminal behavior" and saying that minor criminal behavior (smoking weed, stealing food, etc) normalize other criminal behavior (murder, rape, etc) regardless of the clear distinction in severity.

Yes it is like driving drunk, you're not 100% yourself, and you're right, it is still illegal, which means that you still shouldn't drive under the influence of marijuana because then it's double penalties. As I said, no matter how much you deny it, Driving High and Driving drunk pose the same probability of an accident on the road.

Obama is Bush's third term. Obama didn't end the Iraq war. The Iraq war only ended because Iraq refused to give US troops immunity past the date that Bush set for withdraw. Obama wanted to keep us in there longer. How pathetic and ironic that we only finally left Iraq according to Bush's timetable.Obama has kept prosecuting pot smokers in spectacular fashion, despite promises not to bother them anymore.Obama has been complicit with Eric Holders Fast and Furious disaster. At the least Obama should call for Holder to be fired and put on trial. But no, Obama is keeping him around. Obama continued Bush's banker bailouts, and kept around the same Wall St. goons that Bush appointed. So if you want Bush to have a fourth term (he's already had three), vote Obama!

>All studies done, to date, refute that statement, showing that cannabis usage is less harmful for your lungs than living in a metro area and breathing in smog every day.sure, if you mean every study funded by the Cypress Hill Institute of Bongology. >Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. **Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer**;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.>Nonetheless, **marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.8 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.**http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/marijuana.html

According to latest [SoonerPoll](http://soonerpoll.com/poll-oklahomans-views-of-marijuana-are-changing/) results, Oklahomans are ready to consider marijuana for medicinal purposes and decriminalization. The poll had support for medical marijuana at 71% and support for decriminalization at 57%. The poll did not ask about legalization.The results from this 2013 poll seem too good to be true and I'd like to see another poll done.

The government does not sell cigarettes, rather the tobacco companies does. The government allow the tobacco companies to sell cigarettes for a couple of reason. One is because of special interest money contribution by the big companies. They just basically buy out your elected officials. Two, it's better to legalize it and tax it to generate some tax money and to keep the black market for existing just like the marijuana industry.

Actually first time minor possession charges are Misdemeanors. Small amounts of possession of marijuana only becomes a felony after repeat offenses. If you are into enough that you are charged with transportation, production, or distribution then what you are doing is more than just a little mistake.....

The thing I have against alcohol (though I'm not saying it should be banned) is that it can (and often does) cause a person to lose control of one's own behavior.Since we as a society allow such a substance to be widely available, the PTB really allow their hand to show when arguing that cannabis should be banned to protect people from themselves.

1. You would not be able to consume marijuana of any form in public. You are allowed to transport marijuana, but you cannot be under the influence of marijuana while driving. Those are the general rules set forth in other medical and recreational marijuana states, and I'm sure that they will remain the same for ours, too.2. Medical marijuana cards are non-transferrable. Unless the state has an agreement in utilizing medical marijuana cards from another state, you could not use a California MMJ card and carry marijuana in Missouri and expect protection until you receive a Missouri MMJ card and Missouri has finalized the laws behind when medical marijuana will be allowed.

I don't know that doctors will be any more willing to sign up medical cannabis patients, since the legal ramifications of what happens to that cannabis they prescribed is on the doctor. Do you know any doctors that are willing to lose their medical license on the off chance that the patient they're helping does something stupid?

Concealed is concealed. If anyone knows you have a gun before you have to draw it in lawful self defense, you've failed. I legally carry a concealed gun every day, including to parties and to weed deals. No one has ever been able to tell, and only my girlfriend knows.Also, remember it's not yet legal for you to carry concealed. You have to wait and get a permit.

A woman was murdered,” he says and then starts pointing. At a house 50 feet down the street on the same side, people “have been murdered there.” And at a house across the street from that one?The country is no bigger than Massachusetts, with the same population. Yet in El Salvador, an average of 12 people are murdered every day. And children and their parents are clearly keeping count.Police found three items with her blood on them in her bedroom: a cast-iron fire poker, which was on the floor under her bed and had a broken tip that was in a pool of her blood; a small cast-iron kettle that was dented and had her blood on it; and a heavy metal pot cover that had her blood on it.He said the man was named Jim and worked as a dishwasher at his restaurant, Stadium Burgers and Brews. Police identified him as James McMahon, 48, and he was arrested at his mother’s home in Southington on Tuesday, May 26.McMahon said that when he went into the victim’s home he started hitting her with his fists, and she grabbed a metal fireplace poker and began swinging at him. |12| 43:05 Konec - Immortal Some of the children were as young as 7; most between 12 and 17.Visit our “chill out” zone on the place called “Greenfield”!

when you define being wrong and being right. Issues like marijuana legislation and the EU have are as much a personal opinion as it anything else, you can never know why people change their minds, when you make assumptions about people's motives you only reveal your own biases.You're arguing for a stance of "moral defensibility" and "logical defensibility" when nothing about another person's morals can ever be determined, an all positions can be logically held even if you disagree with the logic.

Basically in law-speak this states that cannabis has been removed as a schedule 1 drug because the state realized that the laws were conflicting. I'm not sure if i's going to be moved to a schedule 2 though.The law (MCL 333.7211) states >"The administrator shall place a substance in schedule 1 if it finds that the substance has high potential for abuse and has no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or lacks accepted safety for use in treatment under medical supervision."and for schedule 2 (MCL 333.7213) :>The administrator shall place a substance in schedule 2 if it finds all of the following:>>(a) The substance has high potential for abuse.>>(b) The substance has currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, or currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.>>(c) The abuse of the substance may lead to severe psychic or physical dependence.>

Straight up, good luck dude! Let us know how it turns outm pointers and stuff would be awesome. I know I got a few years to wait, but I'm prepping already, because my girlfriend had a bad experience with her step-dad being all "See this? It's weed! I can go to prison forever over this, so don't tell anyone!" when she was like six.

Soooo, since alcohol has been proven time and again to be a poison in every way (albeit a fun poison), and since cannabis has been proven to be nothing of the sort (the exact opposite of alcohol, apparently), why exactly are things still the way they are regulations-wise?Not that I think any government should ever be allowed to dictate what you can or can't put into your body, but wouldn't it make waaay more sense to regulate the booze and let people consume cannabis at will?

On a single day large AgriBusiness donated nearly $5 million to defeat Proposition 2... Who are these people? Pilgrim’s Pride, chipping in $25,000, where a whistle-blower employee videotaped chickens being stomped and thrown against the wall. The United Egg Producers, adding $185,000 to the opposition's pot, fined to settle false advertising complaints. They are Moark LLC, donating more than $504,000 against Prop 2, which paid $100,000 to settle criminal animal cruelty charges. They are Cal-Maine Foods, leading the pack with nearly $600,000 in campaign contributions, cited for spilling chicken parts and manure into waterways and killing tens of thousands of fish.

> We were even prepared to incorporate Oh dear, doesn't sound like a good start. If you're running a business, why wouldn't you incorporate? That'd be a red flag from me if I was evaluating your account.You also have links to PotCoin on your homepage, a crypto currency from what I can tell is specifically for marijuana. Not particularly a smart move when applying for a bank account to support your business?Also, look at Candadian laws around this sort of business. There may be additional requirements.Either way, good luck. Had a similar problem here in the UK when I applied for business bank account for a crypto related business, even with a lot of cash backing me and a good financial relationship with the bank with my other business. They just don't want to do it.They will stonewall you on purpose to limit the amount of evidence you can provide to any competition agencies.

But what does "USDA Certified Organic" mean?​**Non-GMO**. Organic crops can’t be grown from genetically engineered seeds (which is generally what people mean when they refer to non-GMO). Organic crops can, however, be bred with traditional methods.​**Farmed with traditional methods**. The National Organic Program requires “cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity,” according to the USDA. That extends to issues like soil quality, pest and weed control, and handling of waste.**Come from land that’s been organic for three years**. Even if a farmer decided to switch from pesticides to organic production, the farmer would have to wait at least three years before marketing crops as organic.**Only been subjected to strictly regulated products**. Only approved synthetic chemicals on the USDA-regulated “National List” may be applied to organic crops. Even [**natural substances are regulatedOpens a New Window.**](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=06b088e611c5f18a4d02ca9945a1c3dd&rgn=div8&view=text&node=7:3.1.1.9.32.7.354.3&idno=7), so farmers can’t use natural-but-harmful chemicals like arsenic or tobacco dust. To be clear: Organic crops are not *pesticide-free*, but they can only be exposed to [**approved chemicals,** ](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=06b088e611c5f18a4d02ca9945a1c3dd&rgn=div8&view=text&node=7:3.1.1.9.32.7.354.2&idno=7)and *only* when [**allowed organic standards**](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=75aaa3aea872d1a02e93fff863ffcbb6&mc=true&n=pt7.3.205&r=PART&ty=HTML#se7.3.205_1206) aren’t enough to manage pests, weeds, or crop diseases.

And with the driving while high. People still drive high all the time and not many people are ever charged with driving while intoxicated or even pulled over for that matter. It is nothing like driving drunk and if I am high and am driving fine, they will have no clue and I wont be pulled over. If I'm driving recklessly or too high to drive and put someone else at risk I should be pulled over but people drive high daily and you dont see much of it on the news as opposed to drunk driving or driving on other legal drugs. Hell even a tobacco buzz impairs me more than weed when I drive.

**Lactuca virosa**Lactuca virosa is a plant in the Lactuca (lettuce) genus, ingested often for its mild analgesic and sedative effects. It is related to common lettuce (L. sativa), and is often called wild lettuce, bitter lettuce, laitue vireuse, opium lettuce, poisonous lettuce, tall lettuce, great lettuce or rakutu-karyumu-so.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I am an OK resident who smoked for a long time (not anymore though). I admit I have driven drunk. I have driven high. I have driven under the influence of prescription drugs (oxy, etc). While I don't support driving under the influence of anything at anytime, I have to say that driving while under the influence of marijuana is absolutely nothing compared to driving drunk. Yes they are both dangerous. The safety of driving while under the influence should have nothing to do with the argument for legalization because of the overwhelming dangers of driving drunk. People who make the argument against legalization and use the driving while stoned issue hold absolutely no credibility in my mind.

That's funny, I live in 'Merica. Texas in fact, weed is illegal here. But since I was 13 I've known where I can go to get some. Just the fact that it's illegal makes no difference in how really easy it is to get for anyone that wants it. Same goes for anything illegal really.

The pot is probably a voltage divider. So, you can remove it and provide a voltage to control the output current. Since an Arduino doesn't have a controllable output voltage you need to add some circuit to get it. Fortunately, this is easy. Add a resistor to a PWM output and put a capacitor to ground a the other side of the resistor. The voltage on the capacitor will change with the PWM duty cycle and can be used to control the boost regulator.

This may solve some of the marijuana industry's issues, but not those that are most pressing. If this bank is handling marijuana-derived funds, it is nearly impossible to connect it to the financial system at large without running afoul of federal law. Depositing checks from other financial institutions, processing money transfers, a whole host of day-to-day transactions would still be impossible.

Does your company test for that? Of course they don't, so no shit they wouldn't fire you for that. If you lived in a state where weed was legal, but your company still prohibited the use of it, you bet your sweet ass you're getting fired for failing a drug test with weed in your system if they find out. If they don't fire you on the spot, they're going to drug test you again, then fire your ass. Brock failed a drug test, with a drug that **both** companies have prohibited.

>Are you stupid? He can't just tag Madara without having to first touch him which is a very difficult task to do. Not even the Raikage could hit Madara without the assistance of other kages.Are you possessing an insufficiently functioning brain? Minato literally just needs to touch him with his hand. Done, he's been marked. The 5 Kage aren't Minato. >And Hashirama is leagues above Minato's level. First of all he's great at taijutsu, good enough to rival Madara with his sharingan activated. And he has constant healing, he doesn't need to use any seals. Not to mention his pollen jutsu covers a massive area. And if he wants he could always use sage mode to buff himself and become twice as strong. I could go on and on but Hashirama is the strongest kage and is known as the strongest kage in the manga for a reason.Naruto is the strongest Kage, not Hashirama.

I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who fought against Dojutsu masters, Uchiha Itachi and Uzumaki Nagato whilst getting rekt by Uzumaki Nagato despite Uchiha Itachi switching sides and the 3v1 advantage. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who clashed with warlord and genocidal maniac, Tobi along with his 6 Paths of Jinchuuriki: Nii Yugito, Yondaime Mizukage, Yagura, Roshi, Han and Fuu. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who unmasked Tobi and exposed his true identity as warlord, genocidal maniac and former best friend of Hatake Kakashi as Uchiha Obito, with the help of Hatake Kakashi, Might Guy and Killer Bee. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who Talk no Justu's Bijuu, Kurama and attained and mastered Bijuu Modo in a matter of minutes. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who used the Shinobi Alliance no Jutsu on Uchihas Madara and Obito. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who had beloved fan favourite and elite Byakugan prodigy, Hyuuga Neji die in his arms after he sacrificed himself to save him and T H I C C Hyuuga Hinata. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who got Despair no Jutsu'd by Uchiha Obito, but was saved by Hyuuga Hinata. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who witnessed the arrival of the 4 Hokage: Massive Wood, Senju Hashirama, Mr. I Invented That and Uchiha hater, Senju Tobirama, Go on, Danzo, Fuck up My Village, Sarutobi Hiruzen and Hiraishin master, Namikaze Minato and edgy best friend, Uchiha Sasuke. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who defeated Uchiha Juubito and Talk no Jutsu'd Juubito back into Obito.

A conversation with his father is more than enough for Naruto to let his guard down. It's over.

I have 2 sisters. My older sister I don't really remember since I was younger still, but I do remember she was always in trouble with my parents. I never really got in trouble, so there was a difference there. My younger sister is definitely the goodie of the family. Always hated pot/ any other drugs and very rarely drank so they never had that problem with her because she naturally just stayed away from it. Yes, she would drink though with her friends at our house with some wine coolers or something like that and she always asked my mom before doing it.The sex part is a little different. My little sister I know told my mom basically everything when it came to the sex stuff. (As a brother I didn't want to know lol). We all had the same rules for the most part. I don't know if my mom put her on birth control or the specifics i just know that my mom knew.We had the same general rules though. No sex in the house ever. Don't get anyone or become pregnant. My little sister and I never got in trouble with the law and did good in school so I think my mom was more relaxed with us. Plus my mom & dad split when I was in middle school and my dad was the strict one. If it was against the law at all my dad would freak out and he is very judgement so I am sure he didn't really know about anything going on with in our personal lives.They were a little more strict with my sister though as instead of midnight for me she probably had 10:30 or 11 and instead of me telling my mom who i was with. My mom usually knew the parents of ALL of my sisters friends parents so she could always talk to them, etc. Again my little sister never really did anything wrong, she was always the "mom" sibling.

You're completely missing the point that the people saying that marijuana can cause some harm **aren't** saying that it should be outlawed. Alcohol causes harm. We all know that. It'd be ridiculous to say that alcohol consumption is completely harmless. But we also don't outlaw it.

Because you can legally drive with any BAC level under .08 but you cant smoke any weed whatsoever and drive thats stupid. Weed does not impair driving the same way a .08 bac will.

When the U.S legalizes marijuana, then the rest of the 1st world nations follow in footsteps. When the U.S calls SC a sport, then it is official world wide. Why? Because the U.S is the leader of the world, most powerful nation on planet Earth.

Lol this episodeI love how they started off carter wanting to find and arrest/kill him in season 1, then they're in love(?)Not an awful episode, just not my favorite. Kinda farfetched and over dramatic to me, but it was a good filler episode. Not complaining, still well done and entertaining to watch. Edit: wish they did the weed episode for this episode. Damn.Also I might add, it was really cool to see carter again, she was a great character.

In two years there will be another administration that will continue the gradual decriminalization of marijuana. The GOP has always been about the war on drugs, and they’re just promoting their agenda even if it’s a failed one. They like promoting failed policies decades after they’ve been demonstrated to be a sham.

No they might not be able to produce it for less, but with the taxes the dealers will be SELLING it for less. That's what I mean when I say they have to do this properly. If they sell it for a reasonable rate without *too* much regulation, the underground market (dealers and distributors) will take a hit, otherwise people won't volunteer to pay more and will continue to just buy it from their current supplier (if they have one). Producers can grow a lot of weed.

This is called the "gateway myth" and it's been de-bunked: From http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/factsmyths/#gatewayMyth: Marijuana is a Gateway Drug. Even if marijuana itself causes minimal harm, it is a dangerous substance because it leads to the use of "harder drugs" like heroin, LSD, and cocaine.Fact: Marijuana does not cause people to use hard drugs. What the gateway theory presents as a causal explanation is a statistic association between common and uncommon drugs, an association that changes over time as different drugs increase and decrease in prevalence. Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug in the United States today. Therefore, people who have used less popular drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and LSD, are likely to have also used marijuana. Most marijuana users never use any other illegal drug. Indeed, for the large majority of people, marijuana is a terminus rather than a gateway drug.

Cannabis oil won't cure her cancer or treat it effectively. She needs to listen to her doctor and take what he/she prescribes and use cannabis and cannabis oil as an aid for the pain and to help her eat and stay in good spirits. To get it illegally you can check out /r/darknetmarkets, read the sidebar and rules. I am unsure of the NY medical cannabis legality, but it is something you should absolutely discuss with her primary physician, he/she would know more about it.

You bastard. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas... I’ll bet you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a dick than be seen with you.You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter.

The first one, he saying legal weed should be a state issue, not medical. The second one, he's saying a state should decide to legalize recreational marijuana.The third one he is saying medical marijuana should be legal, and that recreational should be left up to the states. He's said before he is a big believer in medical marijuana, and that he knows people who use it, and he's seen how it has helped them.

I've just found the Portuguese stats. The interesting fact is that the lifetime usage went up while the annual usage was stable. This suggests more people experimenting but no more habits being formed.Also cannabis use dropped a fair chunk (on an annual basis) among the youngest user group.Another interesting stat is for the older groups all drug use increased slightly (annually).Regardless the stats show a huge decrease in death rate. We're talking about a 50% drop https://fullfact.org/factchecks/Portugal_decriminalisation_drugs_effects-3276

Yeah I totally agree with you. With it being legal in Canada and many states as well as other places in the world, I am sure we will see many more of the benefits of marijuana very soon. This is only going to get better and better as time goes by. I can’t wait to see what else can be treated.

No, probable cause alone is not enough to search. If they have only probable cause, they need to get a warrant or consent in order to search. Probable cause + exigent circumstances is enough to search without a warrant. A vehicle in which one smells marijuana is one such exigent circumstance. Here are some of the exceptions to the warrant requirement: http://nationalparalegal.edu/conlawcrimproc_public/protectionfromsearches&seizures/extowarrantreq.asp

I know what an analogy is.You have given me analogies.But there is a difference between analogies and working analogies. Which I believe I already explained.Regardless, the water analogy would fall short for those reasons.It's usually not a good idea to use an analogy that can be seen as incorrect, and then say "nah, this is right, you're wrong" whenever the other person points out why the analogy doesn't apply.For those reasons, the wine analogy works better than the water analogy.I'm honestly just trying to help here. Everyone in support of marijuana should use the strongest arguments they can. Stating simply 'you're wrong' (or insisting on a single point and ignoring others) and then walking away is usually seen as a lazy argument, and does nothing but confirm the stereotypes that the opposition has about the pro-legalization community.

Harry J. Anslinger quotes: ...the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.Harry J. Anslinger quotes: Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.We're both right.Furthermore:Harry J. Anslinger quotes: There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.

Well why don't you just stop calling it a gateway drug then, and just call it an "illegal drug" or "illicit drug". It is NOT a gateway drug, in that it does not CAUSE it's users to move on to harder drugs. Users of harder drugs may have used (or continue to use) marijuana, but that does not, in any way, make it a gateway drug anymore than milk is a gateway drug to alcohol.

What happens when the government taxes marijuana heavily, while cheap tax-free bud remains available on the street? Hint: they buy from the street.There's always going to be competition between the "legitimate market" and the "black market". A tax is another way to make the legitimate market less appealing.

Well here in America going to jail means going to a local jail for a short sentence. Going to prison, means going to an actual prison. There is a distinct difference between jail and prison. Sorry you don't understand that...Edit: I paid for the privilege of house arrest, otherwise I would've spent the full 3 months in the actual jail. I'd call that going to jail for a small amount of weed.

I totally agree. I first started to realise this recently when he went away on vacation to another country where weed is highly illegal. I asked him if he took any with him, just to see what he said. He replied 'No, I didn't smoke at all the entire 2 weeks I was there'. About a week later, we were having dinner and a similar conversation came up. This time, he told me he only lasted 4 days without weed, and convinced a new 'friend' he made out there to go and get some for him. He had completely forgotten the conversation that we had had prior to this.

you mean like most other places that don't put people in prison for many years for trivial things?I live in the US, do not do drugs, etc., but I think going to prison for marijuana/pills etc. instead of getting that person help is absurd. Dealers sure, but not the everyman who has a problem.

It was [well established](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm) in Liebeck v. McDonald's that the restaurant chain was negligent. They knew they were serving coffee so hot that it could potentially cause burns. >During discovery, McDonalds produced documents showing more than 700 claims by people burned by its coffee between 1982 and 1992. Some claims involved third-degree burns substantially similar to Liebecks. This history documented McDonalds' knowledge about the extent and nature of this hazard.>McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.>Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.

He does need probable cause. Pulling you over for speeding or whathaveyou does not constitute probable cause. Now, the cop can say "Hmm I smell weed." or pull out a drug dog and cause it to look like it got a "hit", but that then takes it out of your hands. Basically, if you say no, the cop has no right to search your car without at least making something up. And if he makes something up that can be challenged in court (and if won, the evidence will get thrown out). If you say "go right ahead" anything the cop finds can and will be used against you no matter what.

It depends on what your goals are. I live in Washington and buy legally. I buy from shops that get their stuff tested and is fresh from a reputable source. To me, that is completely worth the extra cost. I wouldn't buy wine from some guy on the street, and I won't buy weed from some guy on the street if there is a legal and safe option.

And then we can made coke and weed illegal too and no one will ever be able to get those either! They already are illegal? So how do people still get them? WHAT?! They break the law to get these illegal things? They should just make the dealers illegal and that will surely stop it in its tracks!

A good top laner can then abuse your weaker than it should be level one the second you hit Q on the creeps. Garen, Riven, Pantheon can punish a Renekton starting Q.Plus, it's easier getting a kill at level 2 if you can get the opponent low beforehand. Which is very easily done with W.Last, pushing the wave early isn't the brightest idea, even more so if you go Q instead of E at level 2. Your red pot won't be of much help if the lane is frozen under the enemy turret.

I think more of us are libertarian than we realize.At least from people I've talked to- most conservatives are conservative for fiscal/economic reasons, and most liberals are liberal for social reasons.I agree. I'm more for smaller government, more economic freedom, but I don't like being classified solely as republican/conservative because of their views on social issues like gay marriage, abortion, legalization of marijuana, etc.

>There aren't many products that can compete with cannabis in an actual free, capitalistic market. So, legalizing cannabis would introduce competition that existing mega-corporations who lobby to politicians don't want.The problem I have with this premise is the fact that cannabis has to be a competing product to anything. Who would stop Pfizer or Phillip Morris from entering the market? Tobacco companies (and possibly drug companies) are in the best position to enter the market immediately. Cigarette manufacturers *already* have the infrastructure!

Also, I too have an r/trees bumper sticker on my vehicle amongst other pro-legalization bumper stickers... But putting a bumper sticker on your car that says "legalize marijuana" is almost like putting a bumper sticker on your car that says "I'm drunk". You're going to get pulled over.

rehabno one fucking needs rehab for a drug that isn't physically addicting. it's just another corporate tie in, that whole industry only exists because the government tells kids you can either go to rehab or jail. then because they obviously choose rehab the government turns around and says "this many kids needed rehab for pot so it's bad"

1999 - Patterns in progression of drug use from adolescence to adulthood are strikingly regular. Because it is the most widely used illicit drug, marijuana is predictably the first illicit drug most people encounter. Not surprisingly, most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana first. In fact, most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana — usually before they are of legal age.In the sense that marijuana use typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use, it is indeed a "gateway" drug. But because underage smoking and alcohol use typically precede marijuana use, marijuana is not the most common, and is rarely the first, "gateway" to illicit drug use. There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB6010.html

It doesn't have to be "taxing more" to be revenue generating. Does legalizing pot and taxing it count as "taxing more" since it was illegal previously? We could do the same for a number of things with bans on them. If the government provides new services but also charges for them to make a small profit is that "taxing more"? If the government raises the minimum wage, that increases how much people make which in turn increases how much revenue they make via income tax. It also increases sales tax revenues since people are out there spending more which stimulates the economy. Taxes haven't been increased, but the government pulls in more money. There are a number of things that the government can do which can stimulate the economy to increase revenues. The federal government can do even more since they literally print their own money.

"There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance" - *University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales* "The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08" - *U.S. Department of Transportation Study* "No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis" - *Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute* "THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs - *University of Limburg, Netherlands* "There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected" - *University of Adelaide, South Australia* "marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident" - *University of Toronto, Canada* "Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving" - *Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs*

Never heard of William Randolph Hearst, have you? He basically owned the newspaper industry. He also owned forests, which he used for paper for his newspapers. He was one of the main reasons cannabis was made illegal (he started the smear campaign against it). DuPont also was against it because of his company's work with plastics, which can also be made from hemp.Edit:Here, go educate yourself: http://www.jackherer.com/thebook/

I didn't think I was being condescending... You obviously completely misunderstood my post. A voltage regulator circuit is going to use the same pot he's using, then he'll need another resistor and a $0.30 3-pinned voltage regulator chip. It's really not the complicated and it will give you a stable regulated voltage.

Or protect the company from other employees. I had a (seemingly rare) encounter with HR when I whistle-blew on a coworker for smoking weed on the job (equipment operator working around the public, so it was dangerous & illegal), and they surprisingly came through and investigated and then fired him, and no harm came to me. So yeah, don’t go to HR with drama or cattiness, but do go to them with safety issues. By protecting the company sometimes they’re protecting you too!

I would get a solderless breadboard and a bunch of components such as:* leds * resistors* caps* LM317, LM78* and LM79* regulators* 555 timers* generic op-amps like 741s and TL082s* jumper wires for breadboard* potentiometers and trim-pots* diodes (1n4007s, 1n914s)* NPN and PNP transistors (3904/3906)First project is to make a variable PSU with the diodes, caps, lm317, and and trim-pot. You can then use this to power the breadboard. If you make it with a rectifier it can take AC (use a transformer to knock down the voltage to ~20V or so), or you can feed it with a wall-wart.You can make a simple voltage divider with two resistors to hook up to this to get +/- voltages to use with the op-amps as necessary.

In such circumstances, placement of the drug in schedules II through V would conflict with the CSA since such drug would not meet the criterion of "a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States." 21 USC 812(b).

Because frequently the bike lane is just a painted shoulder filled with glass and pot holes. OR they put you right in the door zone.Depending on your jurisdiction, some have laws that say something to the effect of cyclists must use the bike lane unless it is unsafe to do so. Weaving because of obstacles or riding in the door zone is unsafe, so some cyclists just choose to assume that bike lanes are disaster zones.

Surprisingly, law enforcement might have a reason to vote Yes on Prop 19 that they have not thought about.Although local law enforcement cannot "enforce" federal laws, they can "assist" federal law enforcement (DEA) enforce federal laws. So, DEA doesn't currently have the man power to enforce federal minor marijuana laws. But with the passage of Prop 19, they might have the sudden desire to. But in order to do so they would need the help of local law enforcement. And why would local law enforcement want to help?Federal law enforcement (DEA) can share any forfeiture gains with the local law enforcement agency. And since federal forfeiture rules are so much more lenient and broad, law enforcement can capitalize much more by going through federal forfeiture than state forfeiture rules. And guess where those forfeited assets go? Law enforcement's general fund (to pay for retirement parties, overtime, etc.).Scary thought right?

I know someone who was in the same position. He came clean to his future boss, the guy who hired him, about his legal medical marijuana script and he was totally fine with it. The parent company requires a drug test He did his best to clean up his urine, passed two home tests, failed the company test, and his job offer was rescinded. He complained to HR, and was told there was no appeal process, and he could not retake the test. TL/DR boss doesn't care about medical marijuana use parent company does. Loses job.

About 16, me and some friends were smoking a doobie in a dugout at the local park, which was closed. Suddenly, cop car pulls up, we duck in the dugout, and hear the police radio and squabble as they check out my friends truck. One friend, obviously high and paranoid, starts sobbing about going to jail, as I found during that moment he was on probation for breaking and entering, theft and a slew of other charges. I tell him to shut up, were scattering the rest of little pot we had in the dugout and dismantle our pop bottle bong. As were sitting there on the floor of the dugout we see the flashlight shine right in the goddamn dugout. We really start freaking out, and to top it off we "heard K-9's" (was just the neighborhood dogs barking) After what seemed to be an eternity we heard the cops doors close. We wait a few seconds and peek up, they drive off and start leaving the park. At that point we decide to bolt. My two friends run to the car to get the hell out of town, while I decide to bail on foot. As they pull away, I'm walking in the dark toward town, calling some friends to see if I could come hang out for a bit, as I lived in the boonies and had no way home. As I get halfway across the second baseball diamond I see the cop car driving down the access road in the park, scanning the park with their mounted spot lights. As they got close I figured I was had, until I had a great idea. As soon as the cops got close, and knowing the road was at a higher elevation than the baseball diamond I hit the ground. Flat as a stone, burying my face in the grass. As I laid there I see the spot light cruise over me, while they drive on. As they left the park, I got up, brushed off, and ran my high ass out of there to the closest friends house. Other guys never got caught either.

The even shittier thing about Texas is border patrol on top of other law enforcement. Border patrol make HUGE busts with weed under the guise of looking for illegals. They can't technically make the busts as they are not a drug enforcement agency of any kind. So they call up their local law enforcement or the Feds to make the "official" bust. In return they get a cut of the funding from those agencies. Source: Cousin is border patrol. Says the majority of his job is actually drug busts and not illegals.

>I notice you added the words "average canadian" despite her quote not saying "average canadian" anywhere. She actually said "millions of canadians". You don't have to lie to make your point if it's correct. :)Uh, how am I lying or "adding" words? There are several polls that state that over half of Canadians would prefer cannabis to be regulated. She stated "millions of Canadians" but gave no context or reference as to where she is pulling that number.Lovely Strawman you've constructed.

Not entirely correct. Threshold for small amounts which *might* not be prosecuted is different from state to state, e.g. in NRW the amounts are:* weed and hash 10 g* heroin 0,5 g* kokain 0,5 g* amphetamin 0,5 g

Because DARE uses worthless scare tactics and overblow many of the harms caused by drugs, especially marijuana. Seriously, when I went through it, it was like 90% "marijuana is dangerous and can cause extremely bad health problems" and barely touched on how bad everything else was/is for you and the legitimate problems that can come from them.Then, down the road, the people that went through it try out marijuana and realize that most of what they taught about it was complete bullshit and feel that the rest of what they taught was probably complete bullshit too.

They want that sweet sweet DUI money. That's a HUGE moneymaker for law enforcement. SO you weedies now get to pay, if you weren't already.They don't give a Tim Hortons about you, just robbing you blind, although weed should help with the glaucoma if that made you blind.

Woke up one morning at a friend's house to a shiny black shoe, looked up farther to blue dress pants, little bit further up was a gun belt, which really got my attention. I sit up to see a police officer standing above me, who said "good morning, we're not here for you" I sat up and noticed that my bag of weed was sitting right next to me which I quickly stashed.They saw a bong sitting on the table and said who's bong is this, my other friend who was also crashing there that night said "that's your bong officer". The cop laughed and says good answer. They than arrested the person they came for and told us we were going to have to leave his place.

[Here](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/marijuana-laws-and-penalties/colorado.htm) it states personal use only a fine, but if you are carrying more than an ounce you could "theoretically" get jail time, but I doubt that on first offense. > More than one ounce, but less than two ounces. Possession, use, or display of more than one ounce, but less than two ounces is a class two petty offense. If convicted, a violator may face a fine of up to $100. (Co. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-18-406(1).)> Public display or use of less than two ounces. A person who openly and publicly displays, consumes, or uses two ounces of marijuana or less may be convicted of a class two petty offense; fined up to $100; and given up to 15 days in jail. (Co. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-18-406(3)(a)(I).)

i am unfamiliar with canadian medical law, however as marijuana is recreationally approved, you can indeed fearlessly tell your doctor about exactly all the marijuana use you do at the benefit of you and the doctor- you can get better care because your doctor can make sure you're only taking medicines that do not interact with marijuana- your doctor can take your anecdotal experience and use it to help treat other patients who are using marijuana betterbe open with your doctor! it's better for everyone!

No, they are not fully [sovereign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty). Sovereignty requires that the entity be able independently to create the supreme law of the land. While some powers are reserved for the states, others are clearly given to the federal government. This is express in the [supremacy clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) of the federal constitution, and results in federal law [preempting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption) state law in case of a conflict. You're right that they *were* sovereign prior to the ratification of the Constitution, but they ceded sufficiently much of that sovereignty to the federal government that they can no longer be called properly sovereign. They may even be a textual argument that the [10th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) should have been understood as more powerful than it is currently treated, but its application is limited to barring the feds from commandeering the officers of the state to enforce federal law, which is why the Denver police will not be enforcing federal marijuana laws.

These policies seem kind of anti-conservative. I wouldn't vote for any party on the basis of electoral reform promises, because while it's easy for the opposition to speak of electoral reform, once they're elected, they don't have any interest in reforming the system that put them in power. I don't know if that is cynicism or realism. As for the cannabis legalization, I know some candidates are in favor, but I don't see the social conservatives accepting this. If even the conservative party was in favor of it, the liberal government would probably go through with it anyways, as conservatives are actually the most opposed to this.In this fictitious scenario, I wouldn't vote for the conservatives on the basis of these two policies despite of the rest of they're platform. If they drop the social conservatism bullshit, then yeah, I might consider voting for them.

Law enforcement doesn't have the resources to investigate all crimes, so they have the discretion decide what their priorities are. The DEA is currently making homegrown medicinal and recreational marijuana operations a low priority, and focusing on harder drugs and international smuggling.

What no accepted medical value means is the FDA has not approved any medical uses for cannabis. The FDA determines what has medical value in the US. To date no company have ever tried to get FDA approval for cannabis. The DEA looks to the FDA for proof of any medical benefit of a substance. If a schedule 1 drug is applied for approval to the FDA and the FDA approves the drug. The DEA is legally required to change it's schedule within 90 days.

I don't know Colorado state laws, but no one was going to jail on a felony possession charge for under an ounce of marijuana. In my state possession of up to 50 grams (almost 2 ounces) is still a disorderly persons offense. To get a felony intent charge, you not only have to have over one ounce, but there has to be baggies for distribution, scales, large amounts of cash, etc. If someone went to jail over marijuana, it was most likely for this and they are still criminals under Colorado law if there's any similarities between these states.

You bastard. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas... I’ll bet you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a dick than be seen with you.You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space.

"There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers.

According to The National Center On Addiction And Substance Abuse at Columbia University. Deaths in the United States in a typical year are as follows: Tobacco kills about 400,000 Alcohol kills about 80,000 Workplace accidents kill 60,000 Automobiles kill 40,000 Cocaine kills about 2,500 Heroin kills about 2,000 Aspirin kills about 2,000 Marijuana kills 0 There has never been a recorded death due to marijuana at any time in US history. All illegal drugs combined kill under 20,000 per year, or a small percent of the number killed by alcohol and tobacco.Tobacco kills more people each year than all of the people killed by all of the illegal drugs in the last one hundred years.

Decriminalize marijuana would help both increase tax revenue and make prisons less crowded. Increased tax revenue also helps things. If we spend less on handouts we can lower income tax which helps people. If we slashed military budget we could spend more on programs that help EVERYBODY such as infrastructure, paying down debt or again lowering taxes. If people were forced to be accountable for their lives in the long run it would help. If we didnt have such a stupid health care system where hospitals are forced to treat and than taxpayer get billed it would help.

Apparently my previous comment contained a banned website, so here it is with an updated link:Just FYI Indica is not a specific strain, it's one of the few "categories" of weed, there are Indica and Sativa. If you want to know the difference between them, [this](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/sativa-indica-and-hybrid-whats-the-difference-between-cannabis-ty) is a good read for you.

No, I am literally stating common sense. Marijuana is illegal. Using marijuana while carrying a firearm (whether you're legally allowed to or not) is a felony.I am not saying that Philando Castile should ever have been shot - that's not the statement I am making. The point is that he was not a law-abiding gun owner, and the NRA is a firearm *safety* organization.It would go against common sense and firearm safety to come out in support of Philando Castile's illegal carrying of a firearm. The NRA has no political dog in the fight against corrupt cops shooting innocent people.

it would be achievable on state levels. single payer doesn't have to be national, it can be single payer per state.in fact a lot of European countries do this form of single payer, where different regions have different single payer systems in place.so all Bernie theoretically needs to do is first approve the ability for a state to run its own single payer healthcare system and then have state elections to implement it in some state. Kind of like how Colorado started with marijuana laws.

"During discovery, McDonalds produced documents showing more than 700 claims by people burned by its coffee between 1982 and 1992. Some claims involved third-degree burns substantially similar to Liebecks. This history documented McDonalds' knowledge about the extent and nature of this hazard.McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee."Source: http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm

If you have marijuana for medical reasons you're allowed to have it provided it's doctor approved. If, however, those cancer patients are illegally using marijuana to "cure" (note, "cure" is considered as a patient has survived for 5 years without the cancer coming back, and I've never heard of marijuana doing that) then yes they need to clean up their act because they haven't been approved to use it.

I believe McDonalds were at least partly at fault, as they served their coffee at much higher temperature than other places did.>McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.>Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.>Plaintiffs' expert, a scholar in thermodynamics applied to human skin burns, testified that liquids, at 180 degrees, will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds. Other testimony showed that as the temperature decreases toward 155 degrees, the extent of the burn relative to that temperature decreases exponentially. Thus, if Liebeck's spill had involved coffee at 155 degrees, the liquid would have cooled and given her time to avoid a serious burn.

If UTG had folded, it still wouldn't be a good bluff imo. Firstly Villain donked for more than 1.5x the pot. That isn't something that screams weakness obviously. Of course it also makes very little sense for him to actually do that with such a hand on a dry board. However, you still wouldn't need to raise to the size you did as a bluff. Basically anything that he is folding to a $35 raise would fold to less. Because essentially he likely either has a hand he is comfortable with (Kx, set, two pair) and willing to call a raise with, or hands like bluffs with air or weak hands, since there aren't any draws. So the hands you could expect him to fold to a raise (Ace highs, air, 88, 7x) would likely fold to a smaller raise ($25ish).Second, you would probably not raise this flop much with any legitimate hand. Especially when he donks for as large as he did. If you have 88-QQ you don't raise. Kx or better it's probably best to call. As he has a polarized range of strong hands he is content continuing on the turn/river with (likely betting himself) or weak hands (bluffs) he would fold to a raise. So calling with all your nut hands that aren't vulnerable here would allow him to continue bluffing (spazzing), while still getting value from his worse hands.

Well, alcohol and cigarettes are both legal, and kids, even very young kids experiment with them at fairly young ages. Kids also experiment with their parent's prescription drugs too. The problem with legalizing anything is that once it's in the house, kids can and do get a hold of it. This can be a problem because pot isn't good for developing brains. It isn't good for teens, and probably worse for 10 years old.

> So /r/PussyPass is a pro-feminist subreddit, but would never even start a conversation about how to better it themselves?Well what would it accomplish? They know who they mean when they talk about it, and if anyone there were to try to convince the general populace otherwise, people would assume they're just "a circlejerk who want to stir the TRP/MR/TiA anti-socialjustice pot" or something.So why not just keep doing what they're doing? *They* know they mean "shitty feminists" and not "all feminists", and anyone who can't see that isn't going to have their mind changed by them.> How do you feel about generalizations about men by some feminists?Again, it's about context. Someone saying "men don't think that way" and meaning "most men don't think that way" is fine. Someone saying "men don't think that way" and meaning "it is impossible for any single man to ever think differently" is wrong.The difference is that you assume that everyone in /r/pussypass thinks it's impossible for any feminist to actually agree that there is a problem, and I think that assumption is ridiculous considering that feminists who agree with them exist.> So while you admit they dont distinguish, in their heads they do?Yes. As a result, they don't need to say "only those feminists who disagree on the matter of gender disparity in sentencing" every time they talk about it, because it's assumed when someone says "feminist" that they're talking about the shitty ones.

That's a possibility to consider. Not sure whether decriminalization would slow down or speed up things. Maybe with it being decriminalized more people will try cannabis and there will end up being more pressure to legalize it. Maybe people would say that's good enough and not try to get it legalized though. Hmmmmmmm

The banking issue is already here. Banks in OK are unsure if they can provide banking services to the MMJ businesses. Banks that are apart of the Federal Reserve system (banks that keep excess cash at the Federal Reserve; virtually all banks) can’t bank customers and businesses that they know earn money from federally illegal substances, like marijuana. And they can’t just operate in cash. They have to pay all the taxes associated with being an employer and the IRS doesn’t take cash. They require electronic transfers (basically direct deposit) which you can’t do without a bank account. That’s what he means by conflicts with banking system. Not whatever gouging you think banks do.

I feel that it is a great comparison. Alcohol is legal, marijuana is not. Alcohol can be dangerous, marijuana... not so much.

Lol never had a chance to stop legalization!? supremacy clause article VI of the constitution http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lesley-daunt/state-vs-federal-law-who-_b_4676579.html please read"If a state law gives people more rights than a federal law, the state law is legally supposed to prevail. This means state law will always supersede federal law when the person in question stands to gain more from the state law, right?Wrong. The law that applies to situations where state and federal laws disagree is called the supremacy clause, which is part of article VI of the Constitution. The supremacy clause contains what's known as the doctrine of pre-emption, which says that the federal government wins in the case of conflicting legislation. Basically, if a federal and state law contradict, then when you're in the state you can follow the state law, but the feds can decide to stop you. When there is a conflict between a state law and federal law, it is the federal law that prevails. For example, if a federal regulation prohibits the use of medical marijuana, but a state regulation allows it, the federal law prevails"

State law explicitly makes these uses of marijuana LEGAL. The 10th Amendment dictates that any powers not given to the federal government by the Constitution are in the states' domain. The Constitution does not delegate the power to make marijuana illegal to the federal government, therefore state legislation declaring marijuana legal negates any federal legislation to the contrary, as long as marijuana use conforms with the limitations of the individual state's law.EDIT: Spelling

> I got searched anyway because they deemed my refusal to be searched suspicious.The most they can legally do is a pat down to make sure you aren't carrying weapons. They can't do a full on search without probable cause and refusal to consent to a search does not give them probable cause. Of course if you smell like pot, that is probable cause to search you. Since there is no way to record a smell, they can use this reason to search you if you act suspicious. So just keep your cool and don't act suspicious.

>Now, as I see it, morality is something that can be explained in only 1 of 3 ways. It can either beThat's 2 ways: objective or subjective. You just have subjective listed a second time.> It implies that morality is based on evolutionary processes and is, essentially, objective within communities and subjective between communities. No. It's subjective. And once you define a criteria, you can objectively evaluate that subjective moral system.> If one believes that it is objective no matter what based on evolution, than it implies that your morality is not just best, but is best for naturally selective processes.That's only if you assert morals are based on biology. Which is an opinion.>Morality simply isn't subjective, or we wouldn't have laws as no one would agree on anything, and anything would go.Just like no one agrees on which ice cream is the best, or what movie you should watch. *Everyone* likes a different ice cream flavor, and there's absolutely no way to decide which ice cream flavor to get. Right.> Laws are based on an agreement that certain morals are beyond opinion.No they aren't. They are based on common opinion of what's best. These opinions are often times not best for the most people (alcohol outlawed, weed outlawed, religious freedom outlawed, etc).> I really don't feel an argument needs to be made for morality not being subjective as no high ranking atheist thinks so anyway.There's ranks? If anything, I think an argument needs to be made on how you objectively define what is 'good' or 'bad'. Because I'm not seeing it.> If you believe that morality is based on one's culture or time period, than you have no right whatsoever to say that another cultures morals are wrong.Well first we have proof morals are based on culture. And second, we can see cultures' moralities can contradict. On top of that, "having the right to say a moral is wrong" is an opinion. I can do what I damn well please. To say it's wrong is an opinion. That's the very nature of opinions themselves. You can disagree and vocalize your thoughts.>For instance, if you're American, clearly you would believe that Sharia law allowing one to reserve the right to cut of another person's hand if they steal from you is wrong. Within my subjective moral system, I would agree that it is wrong. Objectively, there is nothing morally wrong about that.> However, you believe morality intercommunally subjective so you have no ground to think that. You could, of course, accept that you have no right to think so but that's kind of conceding knowledge.I hold the subjective opinion that humans should be perfectly equal and should not harm each other. It then follows that they shouldn't cut off the hand of a person. I can certainly vocalize my opinion. That's the very nature of why people can vote for laws and the legal system in the first place. If the legal system (and morality) was objective, we'd simply have some scientists figure out what is objectively morally best and be done with it.>I feel this leaves us only with an objective morality that can only explained through an moral establisher.Once you define "a moral establisher" you have turned it into a subjective morality. Since you must refer to that subject's opinion on what is good/bad. And the fact that it's your opinion that they get to decide.

That's actually not true. If you look at the federal budget as a unified budget, then yes, all money goes into one pot and all money goes out. But legally, no - payroll tax revenue goes into the Social Security trust funds and then the Social Security trust funds buy government debt at higher interest rates than most government debt. So actually, the rest of the budget is subsidizing Social Security artificially.When people say that Social Security is going to run out in the next 20 years, they mean that the trust funds will have redeemed all of their government bonds to pay for benefit. After than, payroll tax revenue will be able to fund about ~80% of benefits.

Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.”- Harry Anslinger, first Drug Czar.

Me and my husband went to an office party and we left our car in Atlantic station around 7pm to uber. Came back to pick up the car around around 9:45ish to go home only to arrive to a crime scene. My car was parked right next to the incident. So many cars got damaged and it was unfortunate for the people directly/indirectly involved. I just remember it smelling strongly of weed when we were walking down the stairs to the parking decks.

The word "tobacco" appears once in the article. They merely mention tobacco but provide no evidence, and it's not that reliable of a source at that. And logically marijuana legalization is in the tobacco industry's financial interest. Nor does this prove the claim that these industries are the only reason why marijuana is still illegal. It's a contentious subject.

I've made my own pills before. It can be an extreme pain in the butt to get dosages right. Although none of these substances will really punish you if you get a measurement slightly wrong, it could be disastrous if you're encapsulating something like caffeine or any compound with a small effective dose. For your situation, I wouldn't encapsulate all of them together. I don't know too much about Ashwagandha, but I do know that you can develop a tolerance to Rhodiola if you take it for too long continuously. The same is probably true for Ashwagandha, but you'll need to look into it to be sure. On the other hand, Bacopa is best when taken daily for a very long period of time (you probably won't even see any effects until 6-8 weeks down the road). I would pack the Bacopa by itself, and then maybe make another set of pills with Rhodiola + Ashwagandha. You could probably up the Rhodiola dose too if you do that. I've sometimes had to take up to 500 mg before I felt anything.

Pot is gonna mitigate many of these world hunger, poverty, genocide, racism, totalitarianism, disease, famine, religion, bigotry, spousal abuse, termite infestations, and goose poop?World Hunger - Really? Increase in world hunger due to munchies. Poverty - The supply of pot would grow to a huge level putting poor pot dealers out of business. How are you going to explain that to their starving children?Genocide - Janjaweed is killing hundreds of thousands of people. If we legalized weed it would increase smoking which would accelerate global warming. This would cause even more land to become too arid to grow grass which feed the animals. This would cause more killing by the Janajaweed. Supporting the legalization of pot is like supporting the Darfur Genocide. Do you ever watch the news?Bigotry - Pot heads are all bigots. All of them. No matter what. Seriously. Every single one. No exceptions ever.Goose poop - Okay, I'll give you that one.

Growing stuff in your own garden for your own use is pretty much the least expensive option.

I haven't met, and can't imagine meeting, anyone who goes out of their way to smoke weed just to be rebellious. Every person I've meet that smokes does so because they enjoy smoking. Also, those people always seem to enjoy having more friends to hang out and smoke with. So an increase in people trying weed because it's legal doesn't really seem like it would lead to a decrease in smokers because there are even *more* people to smoke with.

Hay, "nationalized" industries nga po ang tawag sa mga industriyang nilaan lamang para sa Pilipino ayon sa Konstitusyon o batas. Kaya nga na-petition ang PLDT to comply kasi its business is a public utility. Nako naman. O eto ang mga nationalized activities (na nakakatawa kasi ginamit mo pa mismo yung link ng Chan Robles so dapat gets mo na yun lang yung mga nationalized o restricted, anyway):1. Public utility (Sec. 11, Art. XII, Consti.)2. Mass Media (Sec. 11, Art. XVI, Consti.)3. Exploitation of national resources (Sec. 2, Art. XII, Consti.)4. Retail Trade with a paid-up capital of less than US $2.5 million (Foreign Investments Act, in relation to Sec. 5 of R.A. No. 8762)5. Practice of all professions (Sec. 14, Art. XII, Consti.)6. Manufacture of **nuclear weapons.** (Sec. 8, Art. II, Consti.)et al.Alam mo, nakakapagod i-type isa-isa. Basahin mo nalang ang Negative Lists ng Foreign Investment Act. Eto mula sa Quisumbing Torres (Baker & McKenzie), isa na namang **AUTHORITATIVE** primer:"List A contains areas of investment where foreign ownership is limited by the **mandate of the Philippine Constitution or by specific laws.** List B contains areas of investment where foreign ownership is limited for **reasons of security, defense, risk to health and morals, or protection of local small and medium-sized enterprises.**"Available here: http://www.bakermckenzie.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Supporting%20Your%20Business/Global%20Markets%20QRGs/DBI%20Philippines/bk_dbi_philippines_foreigninvestments.pdfIsa lang ang ibig sabihin niyan: hindi bawal ang foreign investment sa ***LAHAT*** ng industries gaya ng sinasabi mo. Doon ka maling-mali. Okay na?**Mali ka rin sa sinasabi mong "nationalized" = government seized.*****Maling-mali.*** Hindi nag-aapply ang 60/40 restriction kung ang iyong business ay *hindi* engaged sa mga **nakalaang activities** para sa mga Pilipino (a.k.a., nationalized industries).Ang dahilan kaya restricted yung mga pinagsasabi mo (restaurants, malls, computer shop, et al.) ay dahil pasok sila sa Negative List B. *Hindi pinagbabawal ang industriya (a.ka., hindi nationalized)*, pero pino-protektohan ang small-scale business. Yan ang mga domestic enterprises with a paid-up capital less than $200,000.00. Pero kung hindi naman small-scale yung foreign investment, bawal ba? The answer is a resounding "no."Magkaibang dahilan. Wag mo i-confuse ang restriction by virtue of reservation to Filipinos (nationalized activities), and by virtue of protection to small enterprises. Yung unang list of restriction is ABSOLUTELY prohibited and cast in stone (law lels, unless repealed/amended). Pero yung second list tungkol sa protection sa small businesses? Hindi yan necessarily bawal basta comply lang with the paid-up requirements (except yung for security reasons, obviously bawal pa rin talaga yun; pero kung wala dun ang business mo, EDI PWEDE).In short, pwedeng pwede magkaroon ng 100% foreign investment sa Pilipinas sa **KAHIT ANONG SEKTOR/INDUSTRIYA** (kung hindi pinagbabawal at hindi nationalized o reserved to Filipinos) at kung may paid-up capital of the peso equivalent of $200,000.00 (to ensure na hindi sila makipag compete sa small businesses).Binalasahan na kita ng primers ng prominent law offices, batas, at jurisprudence pati na rin **mismong** case na iyong ginamit. Nagkataong paboritong kaso ko pa yun, pati na rin yung Laurel case dahil kalokohan ang ratio ng Korte tungkol sa theft of intangible (pero ibang usapan na yan). Magandang araw. Aaminin ko na medyo nairita ako sa sinasabi mo, kaya hayaan mo akong gumanti (maliit na hirit lang): ako ang natatawa sa sinasabi mong dictionary definition at ipagyayabang pa na alam raw ang batas. Kahit first year law student, matatawa kapag sinabi mong restricted ang foreign investments sa lahat ng industriya. Basic constitutional law. Yun lang. Ang disrespectful lang sir ng use of language niyo (lack thereof pa raw ng logic HAHA). Maingay na lata lang naman pala. Sana okay na. Pasensya na kung nainis rin ako. :)Edit: inserted response to Gamboa case question as my second sentence above. Nakalimutan ko pala sagutin kung bakit hehe.

A question for our (US) presidential and vice-presidential candidates:The prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s created a black market in which organized crime flourished. Al Capone had his heyday. Ending the prohibition of alcohol eliminated to large extent the black market, and undercut organized crime.Today marijuana is prohibited, and the lucrative black market is the source of major profits for organized crime. Marijuana is a less addictive substance than alcohol, and like alcohol is used responsibly by a majority of the people who indulge in it. Why don't we undercut organized crime now as we did back then, by ending prohibition and moving to a system of state-based regulation? What has worked for alcohol will work for marijuana, and organized crime can be hit hard by cutting off its major source of profit.

Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering.

there are only a small minority of people that want all guns banned in this country...but there are plenty of ways common sense gun control could make this country safer...the problem is the NRA fights any and all gun control the same as if it was a bill stripping American's of all weapons.

The reason why this happens is not that AstraZeneca has managed to convince people with unipolar depression that they in fact have bipolar disorder or even that they are trying to do so. Some - probably bogus - studies have suggested that Seroquel can be used as an adjunctive to SSRIs to improve their efficacy. My understanding of pharmacology doesn't suggest such an effect, but on the other hand, I do not have a PhD in medicine. It is also useful in some cases as a treatment for insomnia and there is no calling into question its somnolent effect (although one can, for various reasons, very well question whether or not it promotes deep, restful sleep - not the least of which being that it can cause swelling of the nasal passages which is extremely uncomfortable).If there is one desirable effect of Seroquel for depressed or neurotypical people, however, it's that with long-term usage or high doses it can give rise to dopamine receptor upregulation, thereby enhancing libido and increasing one's sensitivity to amphetamines and other dopamingergics (that includes marijuana).It's pure hell being on the drug, though. It can produce severe dysphoria and will (temporarily of course) make you extremely stupid, unmotivated, and generally give you a majority, if not all, of the negative symptoms of Schizophrenia. (When I say "negative symptoms" I don't mean "bad symptoms" (although they are bad) but rather symptoms which are produced by low dopamingergia in certain parts of the brain.)Edit: Oh, do NOT under any circumstances combine Seroquel with any dopamingergic.

I left school on finals day in-between exams (I had 4 free periods/study halls/watch-fucking-finding-nemo-for-no-reason classes before the last exam). I left, smoked weed, ate Wendys, and watched some TV. Then headed back to school. I got caught for sneaking back on to campus. Had to go to detention the next day, but it was the last day of school so I just never showed up. Pretty ridiculous situation overall. Especially when you are about to graduate and enter a world where you have to schedule your own life, I don't think showing up for my last exam was that irresponsible.

Just a thought. Siguro kaya humingi dati si Duterte ng extension sa "3-6 months no more crime and/or drugs" nya kasi akala nya si Marcos ang magiging VP nya. Leni was the fly in the ointment in their whole convoluted scheme kaya ngayon they're working double overtime to make her look bad. Pano ba naman makakatrabaho ng maayos yung tao na di mo naman sinusuportahan ng maayos at sinasama sa mga events? Pumunta nang ibang bansa tangina kasama lahat at asawa nila (kahit wala naman dapat dun) pero ultimo yung bise presidente di sinama. Napakabastos pa inintroduce si Bongbong as future VP. I swear Duterte has his nose buried so far up the Marcoses' collective asses he can practically smell their breath. Fuck this circus of clowns we call our government.

In general, most junglers like to start bottom side, as they give a better leash that the top lane. Top laners often have good set-up CC as well, and the lane matchups are very volatile (ie getting a Riven a kill will put her farther ahead than giving one to Ezreal). In addition, many top laners are tanks, so they are hard to gank once they have an item. The level 3 top gank around 2:30-3 minutes is very standard.Warwick: He's best at single target camps until he gets his tiamat or Bami's, so I usually go buff, wolves, buff on him, starting bot side and looking for a top gank level 3. With W and red buff you can often get a summoner out of the top laner, if not a kill. He can also full clear, albeit slowly, if he thinks his lanes aren't gankable. Can solo drake at almost any point in the game once he gets W. Jax: Pretty similar to Warwick, but his early ganks are a tad better. He can do raptors a bit quicker than WW, but not as healthy. He can solo drake lvl 4 with red smite and refill pot. Shyanna: Clears faster than Yi at almost every point in the game, unless he goes Tiamat. She will usually go red-raptors-wolves-blue-gromp-skuttle, rushing 6. She clears raptors quickly, so she often likes to steal those. She can solo drake with smite upgrade. Yi: I like to try a top gank level 3 on him after going red-blue-gromp or blue-wolves-red. There is a great cheese invade on him where you do red then run into the enemy jungle, blast cone into the wolves pit, and kill the enemy jungler, saving Q for when they flash. Otherwise he just likes to full clear as much as he can, tracking and avoiding the enemy jungler until he gets an item or 2. He can solo drake lvl 4 with red smite and refillable pot. Kayne: Likes to do raptors early because he takes them so fast, also likes to invade enemy raptors. I try to invade every time my smite is up because you clear so fast and have good escape tools with E and Q. Generally will gank from creative routes using E, so ward a little deeper than you usually would. His early dueling and 2v2 are really bad, so if you can punish him before he has form, you will put him way behind. Amumu: Godlike clear on chickens. I like to do blue-wolves-chickens-red-krugs/B. However, the optimized level 4 clear is wolves-blue-gromp-scuttle>B>red-raptors. Hope that helps!

Here's a [guide to making a stir plate with a voltage regulator](http://www.stirstarters.com/instructions.html). These plans use a 2K ohm pot, so to use your existing 10k pot you'll need to use a 1.2k ohm resistor instead of the 330 ohm resistor in the plans. A 1.2k resistor and your 10k pot should result in a max voltage just shy of 12v. There are LM317 calculators online that will help, and doing more research you may find plans someone has already written up for a stir plate using the LM317 voltage regulator and 10k pot.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/federal-laws-pertaining-to-marijuana> In June 2011, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reviewed a petition to reschedule marijuana. Based upon scientific and medical evaluation, as well as scheduling recommendations from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), DEA denied the petition to reschedule marijuana. HHS determined that marijuana has a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S., and lacks accepted safety for use under medical supervision.

I doubt it, marijuana already doesn't fit the 3 requirements of Schedule 1 according to the controlled substances act. You don't need congress to recognize it, scientific fact/evidence and the head of the DEA will do. Use the act/law itself against the prohibition. > 1. The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.> 2. The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.> 3. There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.edit: Hell, it doesn't even fit schedule 2: > 1. The drug or other substances have a high potential for abuse.> 2. The drug or other substances have currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, or currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.> 3. Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.

Heres what O'Rourke said in an interview... "What I have promised the people of El Paso is I am not running to legalize marijuana. I am not running to make the drug war front-and-center in El Paso's agenda, but when national legislation starts to affect El Paso and the border, I'm going to make sure that our views are represented, and at a minimum, I think most of us in El Paso can agree that what we are doing today is a failure,".

Actually, I can relate. My imbalances have gotten a little better since then, and I have a hard time bringing myself to eat even though I'm hungry. I typically regulate my appetite with cannabis, which also helps with my anxiety and depression. Contradictory to what most believe, I eat better (healthier) in portion and what I eat than I do without. It sucks on both sides of the spectrum.

well it’s hard to say exactly how it’s related to cannabis because for a good while i was on a daily valium prescription, but with that now long over i feel like emotional regulation is now healthier than it was pre-weed. it seems like cognitive functions get progressively worse as i smoke more but upon returning to sobriety i feel like i’m just as mentally equipped as ever. short term memory is definitely starting to suffer though.

I don't know about this secondary violation classification, but generally I think the idea would be that probable cause for a stop is different from probable cause for a search. A cop can pull you over for a traffic violation, but that doesn't give them probable cause for a search of the vehicle, because they don't need to search the vehicle to find evidence of whether you were on the phone while driving. Now, once you've been pulled over, if they smell weed or alcohol, that could give them probable cause to search the car for those items. Once they start searching, if they find any evidence of any crime, even if it's not the one they were searching for, they can arrest you for that.

Use of pot is not anywhere near the same kind of crime as sexual abuse of children. That is a sickening example. If it was your child, would you still believe that people who know it is occurring should not be required to say something? What about the child? Do you think the child has some right to protection from abusive adults? or do you give priority to the rights of the adult committing the abuse? When an adult knows a child is being abused and does nothing, then the adult has chosen to favor the rights of the abuser (to privacy) over the rights of the child to live free of abuse.Do you think slavery should be reported?

> We see lawlessness and killings in other parts of the world, and now and then we send troops over. Very rarely does the US send troops to violent countries. Burma, North Korea, most of Africa, portions of the Middle East, a couple of countries in South America, and of course Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia could all be labelled as violent. Recently, the US has sent troops to Bosnia (under UN mandate), Somalia (as part of a humanitarian mission that ended badly), and Iraq (without any mandate to find WMDs that weren't there), and Afghanistan (to find Osama bin Laden, who is still free). You should consider the effect that US troops inside Mexico without invitation would have on the "rather large" Mexican and Latin population living in the US. > However, my guess is it is becoming more and more corrupt every day. Corruption isn't equal to violence is it? If there was complete corruption (i.e. the drug cartels controlled the government) then the drug cartels would not need to kill government officials. All things being equal, if violence is increasing, you could reason that corruption is decreasing. > And now we have to worry about the violence spilling over our borders. This "spilling over" creates a false image of a problem originating completely in Mexico. If you closed the border completely (almost impossible), and then stopped the drug flow completely (also impossible) you would still have organised crime elements present in (according to this article) over 200 cities in the US. They're already in the US and they're not leaving. > ... let's end the drug war that is fueling the violence in *both* our countries. Let's say that tomorrow, both the US and Mexico legalised cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy and methamphetamines, do you really think that these well trained, well organised groups that are present in *both* our countries would just give up and go back to farming? Legalisation is a false panacea. It may reduce the problem, but there will be unintended consequences.

I've noticed myself that driving on weed feels safer because I'm so afraid of it. I drive very carefully high while instead drunk your motor skills are worse, you're not as considerate and more confident with your driving. I'm of course for banning driving while high if it ever becomes legal, but it's better to drive while stoned than while drunk.EDIT: What did I break the Reddiquette or do you just not like my opinion?

No, I don't think you understand.If the temperature had been reduced by 10 degrees to 170, the lady would have only suffered 2nd degree burns. If it had been 160, she would have only suffered 1st degree burns. Where are you getting this 20 seconds from? As for Diller's analysis being rejected by a British court, I'd like to see a link. You keep repeating scientific inaccuracy, but so far as I know Diller wasn't discredited. He's still the chair of a major engineering department.Also, my Mr. Coffee doesn't give me coffee at 200 degrees, it's more like 160 - I can drink it right out of the pot immediately after it's been brewed. Moreover, I can dump that pot of coffee all over myself and suffer no problems.

With cannabis prices dropping pretty low once legalized, who's going to try to compete with a commercial grow? I imagine it would be hard to match those low prices. If people are concerned about wanting a lower price, they will most likely grow themselves.

This doesn't make sense to me. 'Cannabis' would not be a competitor to these companies. If cannabis was legal, and if the products were sufficiently profitable then these companies would simply start making the cannabis products.Plus, many hemp products are already legal anyway, which makes this even more confusing.

I wouldn't be surprised if legal marijuana is 300-500% over current illegal black market prices due to the levels of tax, delivery, government salaries and pensions that are applied.Without a competitive price, why would an already established black market disappear.

No ours is not enforced. Local police force are choosing not to use resources to crack down on marijuana. Also judges are choosing not to punish harshly, like jail time. So it is illegal technically, but not enforced mostly.

I'm pretty certain it's very easy to get one in Denver, not that I plan on ever going to an abortion clinic. It's easy enough to buy marijuana legally ($75 for a perscription at almost any of the many dispensaries). I'm not really sure though; I've only lived here 2 months now.

The states can make a law that enforces a thing that the federal laws don't. Preemption wouldn't apply. It does apply, sort of, in the case of marijuana laws. The difference is that states no longer have a stake in enforcing that part of the law. They can't keep the feds from enforcing the federal law where it applies, of course and that's where preemption comes in. In this case the fed is NOT enforcing a thing. The states are free then to write a stricter law and enforce it. Edit: IANALBIAAILOLOGIST

Seems like they should have talked to a lawyer instead of other cities in Colorado. SECTION 22. NEW LAW. A new section of law to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 442 of Title 63, unless there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:A. The Authority shall place no limit on the number of medical marijuana dispensary licenses, commercial grower licenses, medical marijuana processing licenses, or marijuana transportation license for operation under this Act nor any restrictions imposed limiting the number of cultivation centers in any one county.B. Every physical location operated by a Medical Marijuana Business requires a medical marijuana dispensary license, commercial grower license, medical marijuana processing license, or marijuana transportation license.C. No municipality or county may create a local licensing authority for Medical Marijuana Businesses. No municipality or county may establish fees for Homegrown medical marijuana.

I wish people would respect the law.. smoking in public on the street does affect people. It really affects my wife, and the smell is quite offensive to me. We feel like we can't walk in Seattle anymore. She's pregnant now as well.. makes it a lot worse.I don't care if you smoke. Just respect the law that is allowing you to smoke, and respect that it smoke is really bad for some people, and the smell is problematic for some people.Whenever I've mentioned this to friends who smoke their answers have been something like "how do you know what marijuana smoke smells like?" (before it was legal, and they know I don't smoke), or "the smoke isn't that bad.. I've never had anyone complain". :(

Anyone have a study identifying the first illegal drug used by abusers of harder drugs? I’d think most hard users probably start with marijuana. How often is the first illegal drug experimented with cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine? That is not to say most marijuana users try stronger drugs, but that marijuana is the starting point for most hard drug users.

It's not hard to find.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser#Origin_of_the_patented_seed_in_Schmeiser.27s_fieldshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser#Initial_trial_and_appealSchmeiser claims he was spraying weeds around his crops and discovered some of his crops survived. He then sprayed down a large section of his crop and saved the seed from the crops that survived. This would be rather odd to do if you weren't doing it to get seeds with the patented gene because doing so would usually kill your entire crop.Schmeiser didn't even try to put forth a defense of accidental contamination. He simply said he should be able to save seed with the patented gene without paying because he didn't buy the seed from Monsanto.Schmeiser wasn't sued for the 1997 crops where windblown seed allegedly transfered the genes onto his land even though evidence seemed to indicate this was not how the genes got there. He was sued for his 1998 crops where he intentionally selected for the seeds with the patented genes and replanted that seed.Monsanto says they don't sue farmers for accidental contamination and in this case they did not. Note that some farmers have sued Monsanto for accidental contamination and their cases seem to have some merit since contamination of organic crops with GMO plants reduces the value of the crops.The only real question in all this was if Schmeiser never used RoundUp for weed control on his crops, did he really "use" the invention Monsanto owned which allowed this. The courts ruled yes.

Well as my name in game is "I Play Lux", I may be a bit biased, but she is an absolute powerhouse in lane, and has the range to back it up. You want to max your E, and just poke with it while also hitting the mage minions to push your lane slightly, pushing the mages ASAP but last hitting the other minions. If the enemy has a very sticky jungler like Elise or Zac, you may not want to push, but Lux is great at escapes if she saves her snare and can often surprise 1v2 enemies after level 6.Once the enemy hits half health, you want to Q. If you miss your snare, no big deal, hit them with E and ult if you're confident you can hit it or burn flash. If you land Q or look like you will, immediately toss out E and ult, detonating your E immediately before your ult goes off (you can E while firing your ult).She excels in midgame, with a ton of damage and some incredible ganking power, but you need to play her safe, and farther back than other mages. You'll want high burst items and a mix of some CDR, I personally take Doran's Ring 2 hp pot start usually, and start with chalice into Athene's , then Rabadon's and Void very quickly. Sometimes I get Rabadons right after chalice. Basically, you want your AP as fast as you can, cause once you're ahead, you will stay ahead, thanks to her practically undodgeable E.Aside from Lux, Ahri is another great champion for mid, and like Lux, is almost never picked or banned against. Incredibly safe after 6, and has some incredible damage with Q, very fun to play as well.I also very much like Fizz, weak early but strong mid to late, he is a ton of fun to play and very strong when ahead.A few others of noteZyra - Rarely seen but can be very strong in an AoE or poke comp.Viktor - Some of the most ridiculous 1 ability burst with his E. If he is fed, he HURTS.Mordekaiser - A niche pick, but if you want to win against a low range AP champion, this is the champion for you. Morde can win pretty much any 1v1 lane, only really losing to ganks, so ward up and be careful, and push the enemy till he's crying behind his second tower.

There are international treaties Iran has signed to. Further, the US can partner with other Western countries to put economic pressure on Iran or even use existing talks to snuff out any possibility of domestic legalization. The US does not have complete control over Iran, but the international community has a big influence and Iran has already signed itself to treaties that it probably won't go through the trouble of withdrawing and rejoining the UN for. It's not true that it could "pull this off with little to no problems." The UN issue is a big one and Iran, as a founding member, isn't going to withdraw. Even the US must consider existing international conventions when federally legalizing marijuana and any drug beyond that would be far more difficult, particularly one like opium that is currently a "bad" drug fueling the international trade.

So it's ok for recreational, mind altering substances such as alcohol and tobacco to be legal but they should be regulated because they are detrimental to people's health. Shouldn't marijuana be legal as well, since it is also a recreational, mind altering substance that has actually been proven to be less addictive and deadly than either of the other examples that you say should be legal?

I'm not saying that we should celebrate people driving blasted off their asses on weed, but the scientific evidence I've seen has shown driving while under the influence of marijuana isn't anywhere near as impairing as drunk driving or even driving while tired, so I wouldn't mind it if the law reflected that. You said it yourself, driving high isn't the same thing as distracted driving, but that goes both ways, it's also not the same thing as driving while drunk.

For certain. I'm just starting to work out again. I've quit weed before, and I hiked for 30 days 160 miles. Helped tremendously. But when I got back it was the start of my senior year and all of my friends, hell most of my grade still smoked. I fell back into the trap and getting arrested last Wednesday started my journey again. I'm not sure what my routine will be because I've never had one. Tomorrow I'm going to the YMCA and I'll begin to find out.

You bastard. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas... I’ll bet you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a dick than be seen with you.You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space.

End prohibition of all drugs. The effects the drug has on the person should not even be an argument to end prohibition. It's simply not anyone's place to tell me what I can and cannot put in my body. End the prohibition of cannabis. End the prohibition of mushrooms. End the prohibition of LSD. End the prohibition of cocaine. Hell! Even end the prohibition of methamphetamine. If someone wants to do meth, they will do meth, regardless of the law.

You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As we sayin Texas. I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructionson the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would ratherkiss a lawyer than be seen with you.You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little wormdeserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, aweasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, arevulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smearedrichly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birthinto this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody,abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you andthen killed themselfs in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species asyou. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thoughtof you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You arevile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs ofthis earth. And did I mention you smell? Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting toimpress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoopwill still be available to readers, but they will be able to access itmore rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, driveits beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose tofly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shameof your ignoble blood. May you ckoke on the queasy, convulsing nauseaof your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nastyand profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus.Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You areunreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land thatreality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statementsof unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do youhold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have moreweight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle,waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous andobnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a livingemptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease,you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You aredank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of allunpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock.You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggishfoot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormlesscrook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. Youcockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup prattingnaff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-boltedfobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despiseeverything about you, and I wish you would go away.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyondthe stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You aretrans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so farthat even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that nointellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun onMercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entiregalaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is someprimordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pureessence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This isan epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me againfor a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorantquestions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any ofthe rest of this drivel. Duh.the only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snippedaway most of your of whay you wrote, because, well... it didn't reallysay anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful.I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load ofbabbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you havelearned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people takefor granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimesforget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find thesethings more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then Iwould have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right".Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luckin the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such ademand on you.---------------------------------cut here-------------------------------

Committing a crime makes someone a criminal, regardless of what the crime is. I support the legalization of marijuana fully. But I don't support the release of those who are incarcerated for committing a crime, no matter what the crime is. Even if I don't think the crime should be a crime.They aren't in jail because of what they did, they are in jail because what they did was a crime.

Like other people are saying, globalization and the other things you mentioned don't really fit on a left/right spectrum.However, the Republican party has (likely) moved permanently to the left on certain social issues, like gay marriage and marijuana legalization (or at least ignore the issues, unlike the GOP of yesteryear). If only because the nation as a whole has moved to the left on those issues.

"Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men." -Harry J. Anslinger, original leader of marijuana's prohibition. Here's another quote from him."There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others."

Maybe you might piss off you little bro enough that he'll tell them it was you.Where do you think these couple of guys are getting their weed from? Whoever it is, they're his clients. And you're fucking with his business.Meanwhile, you just fucked over your brother as well. If you want to even have a chance of helping him, he's got to believe you have his interests in mind. He's 14. He wont think that's the case when you're trying to get his friends thrown in jail.

You might notice the poverty rate is much higher for blacks than whites (~10% vs >25%). Also no one said crime rate was solely based on poverty. There are plenty of other factors, like the fact that black people are [more likely](http://www.nyclu.org/content/stop-and-frisk-data) to be questioned/searched by police. They're also far more likely to be arrested and convicted for the [same crime](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/us/marijuana-arrests-four-times-as-likely-for-blacks.html?referer=) than whites.These are just two more factors besides poverty but it's easy to see how all of these things combined will lead to a higher incarceration rate for one group.

Why would the same need to apply? I would argue that the legal age for marijuana use should be higher than for the other two, simply because the risk of marijuana use upon legalisation and higher average use would be much worse.

This isn't deposing some tin pot dictator in Bumfuckistan. Iran is a hostile nation to the US that routinely calls for "Death to the United States", has taken Americans hostage on multiple occasions, is a major state sponsor of terrorism, and makes threatening moves towards US Navy ships in the Persian Gulf. Preventing them from getting nuclear weapons is a legitimate and pressing national security issue. If sanctions can't do it, military action is preferable to Iran being allowed to become a nuclear power.

You can either break it off with Tom COMPLETELY (and I mean 200%) and move on with Brad.Or, you can break up with Brad to be with Tom. Have you two expressed romantic feelings to each other? How long have you been dating Brad? You hardly talked about Brad in this post. Now, your relationship with Brad is still extremely new, so my guess is that you don't have real "strong" feelings for Brad, so you're clinging to what's comfortable with Tom. I feel like you're not giving Brad a fair chance.I'm a huge believer that feelings are feelings and they are your own and nobody else's. When they start to affect another person (e.g., you're ditching Brad to hang with Tom, or neglecting Brad to talk to Tom), that is when you have issues and you need to shit or get off the pot before you hurt someone. Edited: A sentence.

Far from united? Almost every single American citizen considers themselves as American. That's the amazing part. The US has the most immigrants in the world, and is the most ethnically diverse country in the world, but yet almost everybody that lives in the US, considers themselves as American.And as for marijuana legalization, over 55% of Americans support legalization, compared to only 30% during the 1990s. You have no idea what you're talking about.

[Bullshit](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm). >McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.>Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.

Not when marijuana is associated with hippies, anti-war activists, and civil rights movements! Then a mere ‘principle’ reveals itself to be a political weapon against a very specific ideology. It isn’t about the stilted facade of moral authority, it’s about putting dissidents in jail cells.

Me personally I didn't really give a fuck in highschool. I mean I tried grade 9 and 10. In my high school if you missed class there was an automated system that called your home phone and my parents would give me shit if I did it. Once I was 18 I was allowed to change the home number, I ended up skipping quite a bit of class because I tried to take a lot of classes at the same time to get ready for university and it was overwhelming. Also would smoke a bit of weed at the time...Once I finished grade 12 I returned for a victory lap because I didn't know what I wanted to do for my future.In the end I went to do a 3 year program at college for marine engineering. Currently in my third year, on coop and I managed to get a crew position as engineer position making about $350 CAD a day. Once I actually graduate I write my 4th class engineer ticket and end up making around $400 a day to start.To sum it up I think I didn't really give a fuck in high school once I figured out about skipping classes. Also doing classes I had absolute no interest in.College turned out to be a great experience and I was legitimately interested in every course as it all related to marine engineering. Hope this kind of helped and I apologize for lack of grammar. Tired and typing on phone haha

Oh wait my bad, 185 degrees plus or minus 5, so lets say it is 190.Googled optimal temperature for coffee.first link , the national association of coffee USA, [they should know](http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=71)>Your brewer should maintain a water temperature between 195 - 205 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal extraction. Colder water will result in flat, underextracted coffee while water that is too hot will also cause a loss of quality in the taste of the coffee.crap mcdonalds coffee is actually tooo cold.>Brewed coffee begins to lose its optimal taste moments after brewing so only brew as much coffee as will be consumed immediately. If it will be a few minutes before it will be served, the temperature should be maintained at 180 - 185 degrees Fahrenheitok maybe it is just about right

UK here. We have quite a few drugs that are restricted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, classified by Schedule. Not all of the recreational illegal drugs have medicinal uses (Schedule 1 drugs notably LSD and cannabis, with exceptions). However cocaine, amfetamines, diamorphine (heroin) are used. Cocaine and heroin especially can be prescribed for treatment of addicts.

My friends and I were caught blazing in a water park. They took us down to the security building to pat us down and search our bags. All of our pot was in my bag, so when they brought me into the "interrogation room" I was scared shitless. They placed my bag on the table, then pat me down. As the officer was about to check my bag, her radio went off and she stepped out for like 10 seconds. In that time I grabbed my weed from the bag and put it in the underwear netting of my bathing suit. They checked my bag and sure enough, there was no weed. We did not get caught that day. They did ban us from the park for a year though.

Orianna is more about farming for the mid/late game, and there are a lot of champs who can outdamage her early but that doesn't mean she's weak early. Orianna's strong point is not her early game burst, but (if u max Q) how easily she can harass and punish for little mistakes, Opponent wants to get one cs, Q auto them (or just Q if they'll outtrade them) Opponent wants to get a siege minion, perfect time for a QW auto trade. opponent wants to wave clear and not fight u, just auto the fuck out of them. Make sure you auto consistently, and use them to push trades vs long CD opponents, lux can outburts u that is true, however early game if you eat a pot after she QEauto's you or w/e u can continue to auto her to death forcing her to run away, and if she sits there and try to auto you ignite her (or if no ign) flash over any of her spells when/if they do come back up and go for the all in.

You'd likely sing a different tune if you'd lived in New Mexico during this man's tenure. His policies on decriminalizing marijuana made sense, but the vast majority of his governing was very unilateral and reminds me of the sort of policies Bush has been following in his pursuit of the "unitary executive". Johnson did some good things while governor, but I think the pair as running mates would only serve to hurt Paul's cause.Still, Johnson is a free-thinker and politician who does what he truly believes. It would be *fun* to watch, but there would be no inauguration.

I don't know why people are saying Obama would easily win against Ron Paul in the general election. First of all Ron Paul would get close to every single republican vote(half the country). Even through a lot of mainstream republicans(neocons) don't like some of Ron Paul's views, they would choose Paul over Obama. Not only would Paul get 98%+ of the conservative vote, he would have a large number of independents and democrats voting for him. Paul would win over more leftists and independents everyday leading up to the election because he is anti-war, pro-civil rights and pro-marijuana legalization.. unfortunately Obama is none of those things.

P!nk is a very well established musician, she has a lot of very serious, not so "poppy" songs. Like the Beatles, just because she got famous off silly pop songs doesn't mean she isn't to be taken seriously. 2Chainz is riding on the absolutely ridiculous influx of terrible rap songs about the same old thing, sex, money, weed. Instead of making legitimately good music, he's just cashing in on the #YOLO train and he will soon fizzle out.I'd like to say that 2000-2010 had it's own unique sound but I'm hard pressed to put a name on it. I suppose you could say that it was the decade of pop, since pop songs have completely dominated the music scene...but I'd say it was a ton of stuff mixed together. It's a melting pot of music. I'm not saying this decade didn't have it's fair share of "Why the fuck is this song popular?" moments, but so did every other decade.

Here's the thing: Even with pot users getting on the roads, we can expect a massive decline in impaired driving deaths as a result of marijuana legalization. Why? It'll displace some alcohol use, which will displace some drunk driving (and increase high driving), and while driving high is substantially worse than driving sober, it is also massively better than driving drunk.

> What do the owners of the legal marijuana businesses actually do with all that cash? Store the cash in safes sometimes on the premise, sometimes in another location. >Will banks accept large deposits of cash so long as there hasn't been an electronic transaction connecting it to weed sales?No, because large deposits attract attention, the bank requires to see various paperwork about a business before letting you open a true business bank account. And the bank can choose to close the business account if they discover you are running a MMJ business. I've seen it happen - woman running a legal dispensary was banking with a local credit union bank until they discovered what kind of business she was running. They closed her account and forced her to take her money and business elsewhere.

pretty formula's do not mean they are being used correctly or that the conclusions based on the results are accurate. Nor does it guarantee that the study was done while factoring in all the relevant things that can influence what you are looking at.When you leave out those factors you are getting correlation. They largely ignored economic factors that happened exactly during the time they got all of their data.There are sociological factors that are not predictable unless weed was legalized more universally. They even admit that these factors could have a large impact on the study and their conclusions.If they did take more into account and the come out with similar numbers, then it's believable. But otherwise you are just looking at the correlation of two data sets that seem to match up well.

Well the basis for preventing 4 trillion dollars in spending is that we are *already* spending at a deficit and have been for over 16 years.So after 16 years of deficit spending, it's difficult to tack on nearly another third of the debt that we have amassed in the entire history of our country.I'm not saying we need to run a surplus right now, but we certainly can't afford to add 4 trillion dollars in deficit spending.We need to stimulate growth with free/cheap regulation like marijuana legalization. We could cut 200 billion in spending and simultaneously increase tax revenues. *then* as things start to rebound, we can start to invest in infrastructure more.

Why not? If people are going to do it, they'll do it no matter what.So, legalize it and get it off the street. Make sure the supply is clean.But, teach people about it. And not like DARE. DARE never worked because it taught kids that "weed is just as bad as heroin" "its a gateway drug".So, then if some kids try weed, they'll think "huh, well this isn't so bad. Let's try heroin, because that DARE guy said that it was the same as weed."Thus, it IS a gateway drug. Due to misinformation. And the police departments are actually taking out the DARE program for this reason.

If your college offers a certain number of penalty-free drops, don't be afraid to use them.I was put in a 9am chem class first semester freshman year, and ended up dropping it. I stayed up too late, didn't study, and fell asleep in class. Minus the falling asleep in class, this is how I got through high school. I thought that since I had taken chem in HS, that I would be fine. WRONG. I got lost in the material and would have failed, so I dropped the class and my GPA didn't suffer. I retook the equivalent class a later semester and got an A, once I was used to college.Also, don't smoke too much weed. That's why I stayed up too late, didn't study, and fell asleep in class.

I don't think it's touted as a "harmless alternative" to alcohol. The argument is that it's an alternative to alcohol that is certainly not *more* harmful, and therefore should be legal.Personally, I see cannabis as *much* less harmful than alcohol. Alcohol and alcohol-in-combination kill an absurd number of people each year. If that horribly dangerous substance is legal, cannabis should be as well.

I've had anxiety most of my life, and it's the constant general anxiety, and can turn into acute panic attacks. Most stuff doesn't work all that well since I can't find the root cause to diffuse it, so a purely mental approach doesn't usually work for me. I can't ever really completely clear it out, but certain herbals have helped a bit. I've tried a lot of pharmaceuticals and most don't work, aside from benzodiazepines. Neurontin has helped a little bit with the social aspect, being in more busy crowded areas. Most doctors and psychiatrists tend to have "benzophobic" personalities for whatever reason, so that's not a viable option for many. Marijuana is also a great alternative if it's legal, but it is very expensive in areas with medical marijuana licenses. Herbals that have helped me in the past by taking the edge off, or things I would recommend: Kava root powder, Ashwagandha, N-Aceytl Cysteine, Bacopa Monnieri, Huperzine A, Rhodiola, SAM-e.If your anxiety is coming from problems with GABA, then things like L-Theanine, Passionflower, Picamilon, Valerian, Chamomile, 5-HTP or Tryptophan might help rebalance somewhat. The GABA supplement itself doesn't cross the blood brain barrier for most people, and this didn't have any effect for me when I tried it.Some people can have less neurotransmitter activity because of an MTHFR mutation. Usually the problem is from the body not being able to process folate properly in folic acid form, and a special vitamin can help those people with that specific condition.I use other things in small increments, taking a few days off in between because they have risk of dependency. These ones are Phenibut and Kratom. I cycle off and on these for several days at a times. I'm just speaking from personal experience, and this stuff should be researched and one should get advice from professionals who know about this stuff before trying anything here. Hope you can find ways to help you feel better.

You can always try beta blockers for short acting relief if you are worried about the addictive nature of benzos. I take propanolol in conjunction with my benzos for anxiety.Beta blockers help to take away the physical symptoms of anxiety. They give them often to people who have stage fright and stuff like that. I usually take them when I know I am heading into a situation that is going to be stressful for me.I also take Klonopin (2mg) AM and PM with 2 as needed per day and Xanax (2mg) as needed for panic attacks.I usually don't take all of the Klonopin, as the AM/PM regimen keeps my baseline pretty well regulated. I have had to take increasingly larger doses of benzos over the past two years as I have gotten used to lower doses/lesser meds.The Xanax is a recent addition, added by my psychiatrist when I agreed to stop self medicating with pot lol.

Here's how Schedule 1 is defined here https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/812> Schedule I substances are those that have the following findings:> 1) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.> 2) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.> 3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.Your argument can maybe demonstrate 2 and 3. But it doesn't demonstrate 1. And all 3 conditions must be met. There's no reason why the standard of evidence for establishing that something has a high abuse potential should be lower than the standard of evidence for establishing that something has medical value or is safe. The research out there that proves that marijuana has a high abuse potential is no higher quality than the research that demonstrates its medical value.If you accept the standard of evidence should be equal for 1, 2, and 3, you can't have it both ways. Either the evidence for both high abuse potential and medical value are sufficient, in which case 1 is met but 2 is not met. Or neither is sufficient, in which case 2 is met but 1 is not. Neither possibility meets the conditions for Schedule 1.

While you speak truth, it's also objectively true that alcohol (and marijuana) has a greater impact on children than it does on adults; and it's also true that children aren't old enough to be legally responsible for themselves.It's sort of like arguments against circumcision: how fair is it that parents get to make that decision for their children? Shouldn't children get to make that decision for themselves once they reach adulthood? In which case, how fair is it that parents would essentially get to decide whether their kids drink alcohol at an age that would affect their brain development? If kids want to impair their brain development, isn't that a decision they should get to make for themselves once they reach adulthood?

First of all, welcome! :DI'd say your views are compatible. I'll address them individually below. I have to say, there is more to being a Christian than just being "compatible" in regards to certain issues; in fact, on most of the issues you listed, Christians can and do have widely varying beliefs, and yet all are Christians nevertheless. To be a Christian, you must have faith in Jesus Christ, and believe that* He is the Son of God, the Messiah, the savior * He was born of a virgin, died for our sins, was resurrected, ascended into heaven, and will return one day to judge the living and the deadOther points:* He established His Church on earth, entrusting her to preach the Gospel and administer certain Sacraments, which are "efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us."* The Holy Bible is a divinely-inspired collection of books that guide and teach us and tell us of God's plan for mankind, of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, and of the acts of the early Church.Now, to your points individually....*I support legalization of gay marriage.*Many of us do, myself included. I do not support Churches performing or recognizing same-sex weddings, however. *I believe in evolution. (Can science coexist with Christianity?)*So do I, and yes it can! Most of the folks here accept evolution and science.*I support legalization of marijuana.*Again, many of us do as well, myself included. For me, personally, I see no objective rational basis to criminalize marijuana when alcohol is legal. *I believe all believers and non-believers go to heaven IF they did good deeds in their lives.* I will have to disagree with you here, as I believe that good works cannot by themselves save you; you must first have faith, which leads to good works. However, there are other Christians who will agree with you. *I believe there is a higher power, God, who created us.* This is, of course, what we believe! *I believe we all have bad things (sins) in our minds and souls that we need to fight off by teachings of Jesus.*While I don't necessarily agree with this view of sin, I don't think it's incompatible with Christianity. *I believe in the Ten Commandments.*Well, so do we!

[A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana)Further down: "In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.""Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time."

Waited to see how you were going to link pot legalization and tipping your waiter. It was a stretch, but you worked it.That said, even though you earn less than minimum wage, the restaurant is legally obligated to pay you the difference if the amount of tips you earn for that pay period is less than minimum wage based on the amount of hours that you work. So it's a little bit dishonest to claim that if someone doesn't tip you that you'll bring home less than minimum wage because the *least* you'll bring home is minimum wage.That said I **always** tip well because minimum wage is pretty much slavery wages anyway.

For me it was mostly a slow fade. We were roommates in college he had a girlfriend that he often fingered while I was sleeping but I woke up most of the time and it was awkward. This was at about 3am most nights and I had 8am classes. Then he started growing weed and I decided that I didn't want a criminal record and we stopped talking and parted ways a week or two later when summer break came.I've been dating his ex...

"Bitcoin and the unbankables"Many people in the first world are unbankable - banks don't want to do business with them, they can't get a credit card or a loan because of their profession (adult actors), the business they run (medicinal marijuana stores), or their history (bankruptcies). Similar, there is a new strain of unbankables - the Bitcoin businesses. Despite complying with all regulations, many Bitcoin businesses can't get a bank account or have their current ones shut down.Banks are needed to function in today's world - to transfer money, to hold money, etc. Cutting people off from the banking services is like cutting them from the utilities.Since Bitcoin is an inclusive technology, it allows the unbankable to do everything the banking sector offers without the fear of being shut down, without the fees or red tape. This should be the core of the story - talking about how Bitcoin solves the problems of the unbankables and how banks impose their agenda on the money.

Even tho you can't go to a dispensary, and people can't legally *sell* you marijuana...you can legally buy it off the black market. It's very easy to find someone [on craigslist](http://denver.craigslist.org/search/?areaID=13&subAreaID=&query=mmj+64&catAbb=sss) willing to do a deal. And, as you can see, a lot of these folks have a decent selection. It's not the full experience, but probably a lot better than what you're used to.

> The school no longer sanctioned the trip nor paid so they didn't have a right to do that, since also it wasn't during school time.Read the "Bong Hits for Jesus" Supreme Court decision. The school probably did have the right to suspend the kids.Justice Roberts wrote that schools have a duty to protect kids and (in that case) marijuana was a danger to them, so they had the right to suspend a kid who didn't go to school that day and wasn't on school grounds because he was holding a sign that said, "Bong Hits for Jesus".(Assuming this is America, of course.)

Anong ibig sabihin mo sa "walang legal standing"? Hindi siniseryoso ng mga abogado?

potentially, yes, but not in the way that most people mean. not in the way that it causes people to go, "weed's not enough, i need something harder."i think it can be a gateway drug in that many kids try it and say, "holy shit, adults have been lying to me my whole life. my life's not messed up, nobody got hurt, i'm not a junkie addict loser now. what else did they lie to me about? what other drugs actually really like? what about alcohol, it's a drug, why is getting drunk ok and smoking weed isn't?"i think marijuana legalization and being more honest and realistic about it is key.

The entire point of a moderate Democrat being voted into office is to represent the will of the people who voted for them...if you got them to move so so far from center to the left they would just be voted out by the very same Democrats who voted them in because they were expecting the candidate to be center left instead of hard left. If you didn't have enough people who agreed with your leftist views in the first place...what makes you think the center left voters who voted for the original center left candidate wouldn't just vote in a new candidate more to the center if you are, in fact, able to push the original candidate they elected to the left or far left. Also, as far as weed goes...even President Trump is favoring it, even though Sessions isn't and that issue has become more bipartisan than I think many people realize, so I wouldn't say that Feinstein being in favor of weed is really that big of a step to much more controversial policies even within the Democratic Party. You might be a social democrat, democratic socialist, or socialist; however that doesn't mean every Democrat is one. I think the Democratic primary in 2016 showed this divide.

Honestly it would be really difficult to give those numbers. If a lot of things changed (reduced defense budget, consolidated all health services under a universal healthcare plan, marijuana legalization and taxation, etc), the new tax rate could be lower, if nothing changed, the new tax rate would have to be much higher to account for all our currently wasteful spending.

Do you think the government doesn't know all of this already? It's all a monopoly, where if marijuana is legalised it will put alcohol companies and Pharmaceutical companies in heavy losses and moreover the Black Market Marijuana "Businesses" would lose their power.

Also Hemp vs. wood for paper. Basically people from the wood industry lobbied to get all cannabis outlawed because hemp was so much cheaper to produce for paper than it was to produce it from trees.

Yeah. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't read it either."The neonates of heavy-marijuana-using mothers had better scores on autonomic stability, quality of alertness, irritability, and self-regulation and were judged to be more rewarding for caregivers. "They try to suggest other factors give these results - "suggest that the better scores of exposed neonates at 1 month are traceable to the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal development"This means either the effect of Marijuana on unborn children has positive effects or NO negative effects or negative effects so negligible, social-economic factors can overcome them and make them positive. Is it just me or is this big news? Why haven't we heard of this before? This study was done in 1994!

Hrphm ... North carolina thinks they are in the south evidently. No damn way NC is gonna come in behind the real bible belt in legalizing marijuana. Even been to Mississippi or Arkansas? NC is NY by comparison.

There isn't a single country in the world that has a death penalty for having a bag of weed.

The only reason I ever feel down about being an every day smoker is when I think about all the people I lie too. If it was legal, I wouldn't hate it at all. I just enjoy how much nicer I am to other people when I know I can go home and smoke. I have had a bad temper since I was little and weed has been the only thing to help.

[Civil rights, antiwar "hippies" and black people in general.](http://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/)From John Erlichman:>“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

Then you would have believed you were in an actual argument about genuine beliefs.What's your point? Do you think my point is that I don't want to know about whether your arguments are legitimate or not? Because my point is actually that I don't want to waste my time arguing against fictitious beliefs - regardless of whether I know about it or not.>Besides when I argue for something that I don't particularly believe 100% I learn more about it.

People fear that which they do not understand, and prohibition does a really good job of keeping us ignorant. The societal problems created by prohibition become associated with the drugs themselves, creating the justification for its continuance as a policy.It's my hope that the legalization of cannabis shows people that their fears are unfounded and overblown. Cannabis is an important first step towards creating a freer society.

What's interesting here isn't just that Bitcoin is being used, but how:>The special sauce that sets apart Tokken is that every transaction will be recorded on the ledger underlying the Bitcoin system — known as the blockchain. Because transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable, pot dispensaries and banks will have a reliable and complete record of all Tokken transactions, including the specifics of each transaction — without requiring any Bitcoins to change hands (a tiny portion of a Bitcoin will be sent between Tokken accounts in order to record the transaction on the blockchain).>>Mr. Zarrad hopes that the transparency offered by Tokken’s blockchain backbone will make banks feel comfortable opening up accounts for the start-up. He is planning to approach some of the banks he previously regulated and is hoping that his background will convince them that he understands the compliance issues they are facing.

Barack Obama has absolute executive authority to determine the policy of the Drug Enforcement Administration when it comes to conducting raids and prosecuting for drug-related offenses. He commands Attorney General Eric Holder whose official stance on marijuana is that [the government will prosecute people for marijuana use even if it is completely legal](http://reason.com/blog/2010/10/15/holder-to-california-potsmoker), a stance which Obama has permitted to go on public record with no objection. Obama has the authority to order drug raids to stop; this is a job he chose to take; however, he demands that the raids continue.

Foster parent to drug exposed infants here...If they screen your baby and detect drugs in the baby's system at birth, your baby will be immediately removed from your care and put into a foster home. Period. This is where all of the babies we've had in our house come from.EDIT: it seems marijuana is not listed in the MN statutes for "prenatal exposure" drugs - so they might not take the baby for that reason.

Bottom line is that driving drunk, texting while driving, and driving under the influence of marijuana are all illegal and all impair your ability to drive a car. Having a BAC of .2 is worse than driving high in most cases, but that doesn't make driving high good.

> If legalization and better health coverage is what's a priority in your opinion, you should vote following that more than the name of a party.You are kind of right, but not really. This is really only true in the primary elections where, if your priorities are cannabis legalization and healthcare reform, you look for the candidate that prioritizes those issues. In the general though, you might as well just vote democratic if those are your priorities. There are two reasons for this. First, you are incredibly unlikely to find anyone on the right with those two focuses in a national election (either congressional or presidential elections). Second, even if you do have a republican representative with a universal healthcare and cannabis legalization platform it would still hurt the progress toward those goals if they were to get elected. In the US members of congress tend to vote with the party. By voting for that relatively progressive republican you are giving the right another vote in Congress.

Before, warantless searches could only be conducted legally if there was (1) exigent circumstances and (2) probable cause. Now all that is needed is probable cause. **Exigent circumstances** = a situation where there's an urgency that lets you get around producing a warrant. Typical examples are: (1) by waiting for a warrant, evidence of the crime may be destroyed or (2) by waiting for a warrant, someone may be put in danger - for example, if a cop has probable cause of kidnapping and there is a risk of someone suffocating in the trunk of the car - exigency may allow the cop to perform a warrantless search of the car trunk for a kidnapped person.I haven't read the opinion yet, but at least according to the article the exigency requirement is out of the window. All a cop needs now is probable cause. The thing is, I would still imagine that *the probable cause must still be germane to the search.* For example: being pulled over for tinted windows (probable cause that windows are too dark), most likely would not give probable cause that someone has a pound of weed in the car. But if a cop pulls you over for tinted windows, smells weed --> that's new probable cause to search the car for drugs, and may lead to a legal search of the car - even though the original reason for being pulled over was unrelated to a drug search.edit: I should add, never consent to a search. If a cop thinks they have probable cause to search your car, there's not much to stop them. Worst comes to worse, if you're searched and something is found, at least you can rely on the fact you didn't consent and try to argue there wasn't probable cause for the search in the first place.

It has an entirely legitimate use, but people don't need a prescription for marijuana. They also don't need a prescription for aspirin or band aids, or antibiotic cream. Why would a doctor write a prescription for aspirin, band aids or antibiotic cream when you don't need a prescription to purchase these things? They certainly have legitimate medical uses though.

At 12 years old I knew not to get in a car with a 15 year old driving it. At 12 years old I knew that having more than 5 people in a car that's only got 5 spaces meant breaking the law. At 12 years old I didn't knock around with 20 year olds. At 12 year old the older kid knew to look after me and not get me in trouble. At 12 years old I knew the difference between right and wrong.

Actually it can. From what I understand quo warranto is a question of qualifications. In essence the questions used against Sereno can also be used against her colleagues. A similar situation would be like let's say nasa call center ka. May nagreklamo sayo dahil hindi ka college graduate at pinatanggal pero magaling ka na empleyado kaya supervisor mo nagreklamo at sinabing bakit yung nagreklamo sayo hindi rin college graduate hindi pinatalsik. Diba unfair? So ngayon papatalsikin rin yung nagreklamo sayon hindi dahil unfair sayo kundi dahil they're also guilty of being an undergrad. Pero once again, hindi ako lawyer. ComE lang.

Wrong date. Wrong info.http://cannabisculture.com/v2/node/30000May 7 and 8th is his appeal date, written by Mernagh himself. And it is legalization in Canada not Ontario that Mernagh has picked a fight against. To be clear the court is provincial but he is fighting federal law.Even if he wins and, his evidence is more than ample enough to win we will still have to wait for the appeal from the supreme court of Canada.Court decision dates are not the same as hearing dates, it will not be on May 7 and 8th that we will even get a decision that is when his HEARING is.

This was not jury nullification though. Potential jurors are screened for biases before they get on the actual jury. These potential jurors exhibited a strong bias against convicting someone for possession of marijuana. So many potential jurors got ejected that the judge could not conduct the trial because there was not enough 'unbiased' people for the case.Jury nullification takes place when you're already on the jury and return the verdict not guilty even if its clear that the person actually committed the crime.

I think getting a public defender only applies in situations in which there is a prosecutor. Charges for possession of marijuana are often handled in court similarly to a traffic case. No prosecutor, no jury. You just present your case before a judge.

Met her 4 years ago at a youth conference. I was told she had a crush on me so I talked to her. We had some nice conversations but it faded do to our distance and me getting into a relationship. That relationship was very emotionally abusive but me and Christina became really close friends. She had a boyfriend by the time I wised up and became single again. As the year went on we became very open and the very best off friends. I had a huge crush. Sadly she was taken. I was open with my feelings, as was she with hers, and her boundaries. Fast forward to her visiting me with her best girl friend. I had just gotten a job and moved home after being homeless for 6 months. I was unhealthy both physically and mentally. Its showed as we grew a little apart. Then they break up. She was beyond devastated. It was out of the blue and I swallowed my pride and was the friend she needed. She spent some time away from being in contact. A few months later she's in her new single girl mindset, and I'm in a very big self care/love kick to make myself healthy. We renewed our friendship and had been texting on a daily basis. It was awkward at first because I instantly picked back up on my crush and she was not into me in that way. I was in the friendzone hard, but I was still very happy to have her in my life. We continue this trend until early this year. She had started visiting (living 4 hour drive away) more often and we had physically been getting closer. I had also gotten skinny and not to toot my own horn but I'm also pretty cute now because of hard work and going vegetarian(admit-ably to impress her at first seeing as she is one, but fell in love with how it makes me feel.). I had assumed it was all friendship based on what had almost been four years of being so. She saw some texts on my phone with another girl and our first very big fight began. It changed our relationship for a while. We remained best friends regardless. We remained close and became so much closer. We reunite at the same youth conference. The first night there we kiss, by the third day we are holding hands and having sleepovers, basically inseparable. She decides after this week to spend another night but at my house. Now we napped, woke up, and I go to shower. I leave her smiling, but come back to a hate glare. She had found the secret I was keeping. I had planned to move to Colorado from mass at the end of summer. After two days at the conference I decided I could not leave her. I hadn't told her and she drives off. I'm in tears on the phone with my friend thinking I've lost what just began finally. She comes back. Now I have made big mistakes in my life and have been reprimanded by parents, teachers, and other authorities. This was the worst. I was being destroyed, torn apart, and told by the girl of my dreams that i had hurt her more than anyone, and ruined whatever we had. I plead and beg. She decides to stay because now it is far too late to drive back to Jersey. We smoke a little weed and decide it's time for bed. I back into a corner and give her all the space she needs. She rolls over and says "I'm still really mad at you, but I want to cuddle." we commence in a very great night. The next morning we wake up early and talk everything out. It's still a little shaky but the worst has passed. We just made it official last thursday. Honestly I've never been happier, and not in that new romance/honeymoon way. I've been through a good amount in my 22 years (today being real life cake day) and I've dated enough to know that this is the real thing. Guys, she's incredible. Also the sex is the best I've ever had. TL;DR You can become more than friends, if it's meant to be.

You bastard. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas... I’ll bet you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a dick than be seen with you.You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.P.S.:You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, opportunistic, barratrous, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, byzantine, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, libelous, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb,evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystopic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive,mind-numbing, arassive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, socially-retarded, puerile, clueless, and generally NOT GOOD.Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/66twpm/slam/

But it's really NOT the best ruling. He was facing a face up hand and folded. OP was definitely an asshole in this situation, but that doesn't change the action on the hand.Hero's bluff gets called, he opens his hand.Villain folds his hand INTO the muck. Hero's hand is STILL face up on the table.Hero's hand is live, Villain's hand is dead. Even discounting the action and the face up cards, last live hand wins the pot.

Ok, well look at the example of the vancouver police department. They choose to ignore marijuana laws because they don't believe many of the laws surrounding it are worth enforcing. They see more societal harm in enforcing these laws so they ignore it to divert resources elsewhere.

Right, but mentioning the beginning of federal cannabis prohibition is moot when there's a prohibition against *all* drugs. Teach people why the drug war was begun, not cannabis prohibition. Cannabis is only one part of it.

There's no set recipe for watering - you water when the plant needs it. It's all a balance of food, water, air, soil composition, pot size and growth. It's hard to give a recommendation for a soil mix because that fits in with the rest of it - I use just pumice, but I have to water at least twice a day during the summer and I have very large trees in full sun that are fed heavily in very large pots. This would be a death sentence for a shohin tree. Easiest recommendation is start with a primarily (75%) inorganic mix and (25%) organic mix.

But it makes it worse overall. Taking mind altering drugs to escape depression only hides it from your thoughts, it doesn't help nor remove it, it is escapism and it will not do you good. I really recommend not relying on any drug to feel happy. I used to use them because i thought I needed them to have a good night and it eventually got to the point where I'd only feel good when using them. I feel much better now that it's a much more occasional thing, I'm not saying quit them, I'm just saying don't use them regularly if you are feeling down because even if you don't realise it, it is most likely going to make things worse. No offence, but to me your own admission of it being abuse is telling enough that you're using it to escape. Self medication with mind altering drugs is almost never a good idea, even (especially, IMO) weed.

While that's true, finding laced weed DOES happen and legalization would pretty much rid of this problem. Some people don't know any better and get weed from anyone they possibly can, not always knowing who sold them the weed.

The secret is to take the shield mastery from the green tree and the scaling attack speed mastery from the yellow tree. Lvl 1 take W, lvl2 take E. After clearing red, chuck an E into the raptors then run away from them. This will give you like 30% of your health back because of talisman lifesteal. Clear wolves then blue using the 2 charges of your refillable. If the enemy jungler can kill you, take gromp, if not, then take scuttle. Now you are nearly full health, ready to gank. You have to permagank every lane to win early game. Naut has the longest range hook (same as Thresh, but without the clunky windup), use it to make the laners life a living hell.The other jungler outclearing you is not Nautilus-specific, all the tanks have crappy clear speed, even Sej when she is/was pick/ban. Even in the LCS junglers on Sej play early game like a bitch and concede camps to the enemy jungler in case of an invade. Being outjungled is not a meta thing, tank junglers were always like that. Only difference that nowadays everyone is picking counterjunglers.The trick is to always avoid any contact with the enemy jungler, so warding and tracking him is very important.After getting your hunters pot and cinderhulk, your clearspeed and sustain will be on the same level as any other jungler. At this point you can turretdive with Aftershock and ult, because your full combo will burst like 60% of a squishy's health. The earlier your team starts grouping for objectives, the better, because Naut has the most cc in the game, and he is one of the best teamfighters in the game.

I would rather it not be there but I think it's a great way to publicize the message a bit more, even if this whole thing only makes 200 people rethink marijuana legalization, that's a great thing.Also - I've been busy which means not much time for Reddit anyway.

As far as I know that all depends on the growers operation, the reality is that so much cannabis is grown illegally yet sold at legal business that its hard to say. Eventually however grow ops will be extremely large scale, like huge.

Weed isn't such a big deal to me unless it's harming those around you (family) or if it turns into a real addiction like skipping bills or selling items just to have it. I've know people to choose it over really good jobs or screw their opportunities in life for it and I'm not down with that. Edit: Anything past weed I see as a gateway to crime like cocaine, meth, heroin, etc.

>why did you feel it was needed to leverage us to get your way?Again, not the point of the protest. Perhaps it could've done in a better way, but I feel that with what went on yesterday I feel there's just not enough you can do to communicate most of the issues quickly enough. A huge bunch of people are going to put their heads in the sand and say *"You didn't say and do exactly what I wanted you to do, so I'm not going to trust you ever."* well, that's not really implying there was much trust to begin with, is it? Like you, you say you don't trust the mods and admins no matter what, so why would I lie to make you feel better? I might as well tell the truth and trust that calmer heads will prevail at some point. We're not PR people, so the communication isn't perfect. I don't exactly know why people would want politicians who know exactly what to say and how to sway as mods to begin with.If you feel betrayed or used by the mods, I can understand that, but that's not what took place here. Quite simply, this is bigger than our sub. Based on this thread, a lot of people understand that, but a lot of people don't. Yes, there are people who come in here and ignore Reddit at large, but the moderators really can't do that.Anyway, the reason we participated is simple.

I'm glad this worked for you! My psychiatrist (I was seeing him for depression/anxiety) put me on ritalin, then adderall, because I was really tired. Yeah...he didn't even know that I am autistic, let alone that I have executive function problems, but I was hoping they would help anyway. Sadly, they didn't affect my EF. Ritalin gave me really bad headaches, so I couldn't keep taking it. Adderall kept me alert, but aggravated my anxiety too much and just made me frantic, which wasn't helpful. The only drug I've found that has even remotely affected my EF was marijuana, which I've only taken a few times (it's legal where I am). I found that I was able to just DO things without having to constantly talk myself through tasks. I thought that must be what having better executive function feels like. But, marijuana also made me unable to sleep, which is like the exact opposite of what it's supposed to do...my body tends to be really hypersensitive to drugs, I don't know. To u/IvorywTwig, I had a similar experience when I was trying to get Xanax, the only thing that really helped me with panic attacks after they're happening. (Now I'm on Prozac which is preventing them.) Your doctor will probably give you a really small amount to start. It's hard to get high off of something that treats a condition that you actually have. I never felt high off Xanax, Ritalin, or Adderall. I don't know about stimulants, but I do know that Xanax can be very habit-forming, so if that's the case with a drug you want to try, I would think it's important to express an understanding of that to your doctor, so that they know you're aware of any risks.

Is your problem with victimless crimes or nonviolent crimes? There is a huge difference between grand theft auto and small scale cannabis distribution, yet they are both non-violent crimes. It would be insane if we didn't lock up repeat offenders of nonviolent crimes like grand theft auto.

Place is quiet. Sabi we got one of the worse units. Yung ibang houses ay dilapidated na in terms of furnishing pero working yung aircon. The pipes are pretty leaky due to the age. Also walang bidet, very bad imo. Hindi rin ako sure kung lahat nung bahay may ref. Yung ref kasi nasa kabilang bahay. Two beds per bedroom tapos 4 bedrooms sa isang bahay. Two bathrooms shared for 2 bedrooms. Very spacious din yung bahay.May mga amenities like 2 swimming pools, firing range, ghetto bowling alley, basketball court, etc. Pero hindi ako sure sa status nung lahat. Konti lang napuntahan namin inside.Also, idk how you can rent here. May kasama kasi kaming from Napocor kaya kami nakatuloy pero pwede rin daw outsiders. Hindi ko lang alam kung sino kailangan i-contact.

The check raise on the flop would indicate a made hand so I'm immediately ruling out AK/AQ or a flush draw.If he had QQ-AA he should have reraised you PF so I'm ruling that out too. His overbet shove on the river stinks a bit, but his consistent aggression on the flop and turn combined with his river shove tells me he's not afraid of the third flush card coming.IMO your PF raise here is too small to scare off something like J9s if he wanted to see a flop, but that's a big if. So I'm ruling out a weaker jack.It makes perfect sense for him to have any of your three hands to worry about - TT/AJ/JT. If I'm in your spot on the river I'd have to assume my KJ isn't good enough and throw it away.Another school of thought is the stone bluff. Folds around to button who makes a standard (If too small) raise, BB protects. BB could essentially have you on a range of any two, in which case check raising the flop is a good move to take it down there and then. Surprised by your call on the flop, he continues with pot-sized aggression on consecutive streets to push you off.Put yourself in the villain's shoes, after the button calls your check raise on the flop, you have to give him credit for a hand. Are you going to continue to fire at him to push him off? Maybe a 50/50 choice to bet or not on the turn, but if he calls the turn I'm definitely surrendering.So it's not a good idea to bluff shove the river, so with all that in mind our KJ can't be ahead. Bite your tongue and fold it.

Over time those sources will dry up as it becomes less profitable. Unless you know the guy that's actually growing, of course. I imagine most people don't though. People actually growing for profit have an incentive to do so legally to sell for the most money. That's all until the "craft weed" market comes about of course.

You bastard. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas... I’ll bet you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a dick than be seen with you.You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john.

Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space.

I think there's a point to be made that none of us are aware of the consequences. The body of medical science related to the long term mental and physical health effects of cannabis is very much incomplete, in part due to the difficulties involved in performing research within a climate of prohibition. Hopefully, now that some legal states have signaled a willingness to encourage research, this will change in the future, but for now, there is, quite simply, a lot we don't know about the consequences.Particularly troubling is the evidence that regular cannabis use affects the developing brain, suggesting it's potentially more harmful for those in their teens than for adults.

I have driven all across the country from a [0] to a [10] and have *never ever* felt once that cannabis has *ever* impaired my driving abilities. I have lived in several major cities (in the U.S. and abroad), spent countless hours road tripping, driven in horrible weather and on some of the sketchiest roads that most people would not drive on sober.I started smoking a little over a decade ago and I have always felt that cannabis does not impair my abilities to operate a motor vehicle.Alcohol impairs your abilities to drive.Bad vision impairs your abilities to drive.Negative emotions impair your abilities to drive.Defective vehicles impair your abilities to drive.Speeding impairs your ability to drive safely.People who do not obey traffic laws, elderly people, teenagers, pharmaceuticals, drowsy drivers, animals all put you at risk on the road.Being under the influence of cannabis **does not.**

So... all those companies would just use it if it was legal. This "the big companies are keeping it down because it's competition" has always been the stupidest argument. Legalize cannabis, and it wouldn't destroy those companies' business: it would simply become the companies business. Cannabis makes really useful textiles? Well the textile companies would start using cannabis. Cannabis would make tons of industrial products? Gosh, maybe all these huge industrial firms would, you know, make industrial products using it.

The voltage regulator on the Arduino is a small thingy that can not get rid of the heat easily. If the Arduino is using 0.1A (at 5V), with a 7V power supply the regulator dissipates (7V-5V)*0.1A=0.2W, with a 9V supply 0.4W, with 20V supply it dissipates 1.5W (expect the magic smoke). You can use that 9V supply if you don't have 'heavy loads' on the output pins (or shields), but it is something you should keep in mind.

Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) and Ron Paul (R-TX) have both advocated legalization of cannabis. Rep. Frank recently introduced a bill, the [Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h2306/show) (HR 2306.) Believe it or not, it had 19 co-sponsors, including 2 Republicans.The bill has zero chance of passing in this political climate. Most likely, it will never even make it out of committee. But it shows that advocates for legalization can be found at the congressional level. Furthermore, the fact that a bill like this was even introduced is evidence of progress on the issue. Here's a list of the bill's co-sponsors:* Rep. Earl Blumenauer [D, OR-3]* Rep. Michael Capuano [D, MA-8]* Rep. Steve Cohen [D, TN-9]* Rep. John Conyers [D, MI-14]* Rep. Sam Farr [D, CA-17]* Rep.

Indeed. Surprising, no? I must admit that while I enjoyed the study and relatively comprehensive results themselves, there were some word choices that made it clear just where the corporation stood on the subject. Take for instance: *While its health risks are well documented, marijuana also has several potentially beneficial health effects, according to supporters.* Risks are well documented, but the health benefits are only potentialities, and only supported by those already on the side of legalization.

If a law is passed just for the city of Paris by the mayor, no it's absolutely not world news.

First thing I'd do is stop taking melatonin daily. Especially in those doses- 1mg is enough for most people. Using it daily can cause down regulation of the body's ability to naturally produce melatonin, making sleep issues worse. I know this from personal experience.Before I could recommend any supps, though I'd recommend figuring out the root cause of sleep issues. Does your friend exercise, avoid eating too late, and avoid blue light at night?My current sleep stack is magnesium and l-tryptophan. If I'm feeling anxious about the next day I'll mix in theanine, ashwaganda, and maybe melatonin but like I said melatonin works best with occasional use.

Two reasons: (1) still getting over the last GF; and (2) broke in graduate school.My last GF could not cope with being away from her hometown, never gave mine a legitimate chance, broke many huge promises to me and sat around all day smoking weed. We were LDR for a couple years, then she moved to my city, then she moved back to her hometown "for the summer" before dropping the bomb a couple weeks ago that she would not be returning. I would not be able to move to her hometown for at least two years but was so burned by her broken promises that I had to end it. I no longer want her back but getting over a three-year relationship is not something I can do in two weeks.I have begun moving on by going to some social events and trying OkCupid for the first time but at this point feel like I am doing the latter just to have some idea of the dynamics of the site when I *am* ready for another relationship.That aside, the ladies tend to like men with some earning power and being in grad school probably is not going to help me get any traction.

Castile was intoxicated with a gun in a car with a child. That is the type of behavior the NRA teaches is bad gun ownership. It be insane to want them to defend someone who broke federal laws, and basic gun safety rules. The NRA has a track record of defending people of color who own guns legally. And again I don't support them. I am not a gun owner, because I am a medical marijuana user. You can not be both. That is federal law.

According to google, you could probably get simple possession and a simple search of Virginia simple possession states: "Possession. Possession of marijuana is a Class I misdemeanor punishable by no more than 30 days in jail and/or a find of up to $500 for a first offense. ... Possession of less than a one half ounce of marijuana is simple possession (possession for personal use).

It means that getting caught with a small amount of weed isn't a criminal offense. It's a simple violation, like a traffic violation. You can get a ticket (around 500 bucks), but you can't get thrown in jail. If you're carrying over an ounce it's criminal, and the penalties are more severe the more you have. Misdemeanor for 1-4 ounces, and felony for anything more. This applies to Oregon only.

Oh, duh that would help. It's hard for even to think of one other than, "Why?" And she already told me that it's to move back and help her mother and little brother. Her little brother just got arrested for marijuana possession and she thinks he needs someone positive in his life. So I can't fault her for wanting to move back to be there for her mother and brother. It just fucking hurts to think you have something going great and then for the last month this person has just led you on, at least it feels that way, and now they are leaving you. I am just really upset and it sucks to think that someone you just told "I love you too" they say it back, but they are still going to leave. They are leaving you and you know they aren't coming back and they will be saying those words to someone not you. She says it's hard because she does love me and this hurts. But I don't know. All I know is how I feel and right now I feel totally rejected. Same thing happen with my ex wife. She went away, came back and just pulled away hard. Told me I'm not an interesting person. That she doesn't love me anymore. This situation my soon to be ex GF, well ex GF didn't say all of that but the going away and coming back and leaving me feels the same. I also have the loneliness. My ex wife and I were together for 15 years total. Loved together for 12-13 of them. Then we divorced a year ago. I met this woman back in April. And holy shit did we move fast though. She moved in with me in July and yeah it was fast. Now she's leaving. This just sucks.

Dangerous? You're comparing vr to bombs when its more appropriate to compare it to weed. Or porn. Or videogames.Vr is going to happen, period. Some people will engage all day, some people will engage after work, some people will dabble. No amount of regulation will change that. What are you going to regulate? How many hours a person can engage? (we don't know what the verb for it will be, its not videogames the same as videogames aren't TV, you don't play vr the same as you don't watch videogames, so engage in vr works for me)

**"There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers.

I found [this](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/02/oops-obama-was.html), but it was from his senate campaign. Either way, while public opinion is steadily shifting, a slim majority of Americans still oppose decriminalization. Supporting subversive action against marijuana laws is just sour grapes.

They don’t need to undercut dealers. Dispensaries need to offer more to growers than the street dealers. Like if you could legally sell all the weed you just harvested all at once, you’d do that over selling to to a couple random street dealers and risk losing your license to grow.

Flush draw bricks out, and you're underrepped with the turn check. Slam dunk river call for me. If we start to count which hands go for pot sized value then i think it makes it easier. What calls in the small blind, x/c flop, x turn and lead bombs the river for value? 34 suited (not a call for me in the small with the BB and a limper left to act but i suppose it's possible) 55, 22 (I'd be raising flop with sets and continuing on the turn to try to get stacks inside), 37 of spades??? (Is he calling pre with that? No chance i'd say) and i don't think A10 goes so big on this river so i'd be ruling that out. It just feels to me like this is a spot where if you've opened up AJ, played over 3 streets, watched a flush draw brick and have the SB lead bomb river you've got to be calling down. This is a spot where as played he just has wayyy more busted spade draws that value for me. If you aren't comfortable with calling here then you can't open up AJ profitably !

McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees. Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. **He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee. **Plaintiffs' expert, a scholar in thermodynamics applied to human skin burns, testified that liquids, at 180 degrees, will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds. Other testimony showed that as the temperature decreases toward 155 degrees, the extent of the burn relative to that temperature decreases exponentially. Thus, if Liebeck's spill had involved coffee at 155 degrees, the liquid would have cooled and given her time to avoid a serious burn.

Effects on the HeartMarijuana increases heart rate by 20-100 percent shortly after smoking; this effect can last up to 3 hours. In one study, it was estimated that marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug.5 This may be due to increased heart rate as well as the effects of marijuana on heart rhythms, causing palpitations and arrhythmias. This risk may be greater in aging populations or in those with cardiac vulnerabilities.Effects on the LungsNumerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.8 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.

Stuff.I accumulate things. I'm a collector, a hoarder, a gatherer, a saver.We're not talking pricey baubles here, either. I'm a thrifty shopper, but when I find a bargain on yarn or pens or toothpaste or fabric or whatever, it is a very difficult thing for me to not purchase in large quantity.Paper, photos, books, rubber stamps, clothing (often thrifted, seldom -if ever- pricey), toys for my kids, paperclips, glue sticks, half-finished projects, bulk teas, baskets, art supplies, more books, magazines, Tupperware, sewing baskets, picture frames...Funny thing is, since I started using *small* quantities of cannabis, I have less of an urge to collect and I am more able to get rid of things. I also have begun completing various projects.

I don't have the knowledge to debate Islamic beliefs with you. I know there are many things that Islam teaches that are wrong, and I know that Islam has, in many cases, absorbed cultural practices that call for death in otherwise inane circumstances. From what I have seen these actions are a case of misinterpretation, but I will admit that they are misinterpreted by an alarmingly large group of people. I believe Islam has a core that is based in truth, and I believe that there are many Muslims that follow that truth. From what I understand, after a certain point, Muhammad lost whatever divine insight he had and began to serve himself. That does not change the fact that Islam has brought the faithful to God. As far as all paths leading to God, you are right. Every path does not lead to God. However, God is every path, and we can realize him in every moment. Sikhi would admonish the consumption of marijuana, but I found Waheguru through that practice. Hukam is bigger than rules and beliefs. As for the practice of Christianity, I am speaking very specifically about Jesus's own words. It is a commonly accepted belief that Jesus's teachings nullified the Old Testament ideology of King God and we, his servants. Jesus taught a God that is omnipresent. John 14:20 specifically tells you what I am describing. >In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Jesus spoke the Truth, just as the Guru spoke the Truth. The Truth never changes. Now, so far as those who follow the teaching and dilute the message, that is where the problem is. We have Christians who believe that a wafer and grape juice are the literal and only body and blood of Christ. That's quite clearly a case of misinterpreted metaphor. I believe that there is Truth in Islam, but it has been buried by cultural practices that are not Truthful. This is the case with every single world religion. Even Sikhi, which I find to be the most straightforward statement of Truth, without unnecessary metaphor, can be misunderstood and twisted by its followers. I believe that we serve Truth, and if there is anywhere a group of people who also serve Truth, even if they are the minority within their belief system, we must stand with them. Truth does not concern itself with right or wrong. Truth has no opinion. Truth is what it is, and you must accept it or live a lie. We have to be the example of the Guru's light to the world. I *know* there are Truthful Muslims who are surrounded by self-serving interpretations of Islam. I *know* there are Truthful followers of Christ who are surrounded by self-serving churches. If there are people who are practicing the Truth within their religion, we have to be the light that shows them the way out of the darkness. Sikhi, from what I have seen, has fallen into a state of self-service. We have forgotten Waheguru and we are no longer walking in Truth. We think only of what serves Sikhi, but this cannot be the way. We have to stand against injustice with the oppressed, but in order to do that, we have to break free of our own egoic perception of ourselves. Sikhi *is* the truth. Sikhi shows the world how to find the truth within itself. We show the Muslims how to be better Muslims. We show the Christians how to be better Christians. The Hindus how to be better Hindus. We can't get wrapped up in ourselves. You are shining a light on what is wrong, when you should be shining it on what is right.

Should we respect their wishes in regard to being Québec residents? A couple of the other provincial surveys stated people from all provinces were welcome to participate.>In the aim of consulting all **Québec residents**, the Government of Québec has developed an online survey to gather the public’s opinions and concerns on the regulation and legalization of cannabis.>Regardless of your age, **if you live in Québec** we encourage you to take approximately 20 minutes of your time to answer the survey questions on the regulation of cannabis in Québec. Your answers will be kept confidential.

I did this once.I went over to my buddies place, an apartment on the 2nd floor of a house, and he didn't answer the door. So, I opened the unlocked door to go upstairs (this door and the staircase were open to the 3rd floor apartment). I knock on the door super loud as I walk by it and am making up the stairs when I yell out "Officer Barnes hereeeee, it smells a little bit like illegal up here what's goin' on?" in one of my alter-ego-voice-changing-moment-voices. I hear them start scrambling and panicking upstairs at this point, lol.I got to the top of the stairs in time to see one of the group literally throwing a lit spliff in the corner of the room because he thought a cop was about to walk around the corner.Bahahaha.

I'm finally pulling my head out of my ass.After not getting into my college of choice last year, I took a year off, and it was an unbelievable learning experience. I worked near full time for a while, lost my job (due to stupidity). Tried weed and kept at it for a couple of months. Stopped when I lost the job. Temp job jumped for a bit, took LSD, first seldom, now consistently. Working full time, going to a University in the fall, have housing arrangements planned out, just need to sign up for classes, and be on with my life.Getting over my baggage issues. The girls I so desperately loved that did not feel the same way, I am now getting over, realizing they don't matter to me anymore. I'm interested in a relationship, but don't *need* one. A gal will come along that will make up for all the hardships I have faced in the past, and I will make sure she is rightfully treated as such.I truly believe this small time period is when my life begins to change for the better.

I'm curious what "stronger than ecstasy" means for you. All "hard drugs" (ie: illegal drugs other than marijuana) are strong, they just act on different parts of the brain or in different manners. What's your hierarchy here? Marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, heroin? Marijuana, cocaine, LSD, ecstasy?

Additional response ko lang, quote ko lang yung pinakamaling mali mong statement kaya tawang tawa ako."Ang TANONG: Paano maga-apply ang sinasabi mong 60-40 restriction sa "nationalized industries" kung ang GOBYERNO ang absolute owner niyan?"At ito pa:"nationalized industry means the government has seized ownership or has nationalized a particular industry."Tapos sasabihin mo you are not referring to government-owned and controlled?Biglang kambyo. Nung una raw, government seized. Tapos nung pinaskil ko sayo mismo yung Gamboa case (na ikaw ang unang nag cite), biglang sasabihin mo na:"The "NATIONALIZED" businesses there pertain to businesses under government control. In your link, the Supreme Court used the word "nationalized" (e.g., fully and partially nationalized activities) to refer to highly regulated economic activities that are reserved to Filipinos."Tama na sana yung subsequent sentence mo, pero mali pa rin yung nauna. **Reservation to Filipinos does not automatically mean government-owned.** Reserved lang ang ownership niya (mapa-stock, partnership, sole o co-ownership) to Filipinos. Pero hindi siya goverment owned. Ergo, nationalized industries = reservation to Filipinos; **NOT GOVERNMENT SEIZED.**In short: PLDT, a publicly-listed company, engaged in the operation of a public utility (which set of industries are reserved to Filipinos) was restricted by the Supreme Court. At iyong mga reserved to Filipinos na yan ay **IILAN** lamang (conversely, HINDI **LAHAT**) ng mga klase ng business. Ang dahilan kaya may restriction sa mga small enterprises ay para protektahan ang small businesses din ng Pilipino (at iba pang issues kagaya ng security). Magkaiba ang dahilan para sa restriction. Pero hindi pa rin **lahat** restricted (as you stubbornly insists), dahil kung hindi small enterprise ang foreign investment sa isang non-nationalized industry, edi walang problema. Don't create a straw man. Hindi ko sinabing industriya ang PLDT. Magbasa.Ayan, malinaw na mga glaring errors ha. Good day! :)

Executive orders only work if Congress doesn't act to counter them, and technically are limited to the operation of the executive branch. So, you could issue an executive order to tell the Justice Department to cease prosecutions for marijuana cases, but, that won't stop the states from continuing under their own laws.

The voltage at the output of the voltage divider is high-impedance, meaning if you connected the load straight to it, the output voltage would vary depending on the load current. If you connected the output of the voltage divider to the base of the power transistor, the output of the regulator still wouldn't be equal to the pot voltage; think about VBE, hfe, and their variations according to output current, temperature etc. By adding the opamp, you're connecting a higher-impedance load to the high-impedance node of the pot, which is good. You're also driving the output transistor with a low impedance source, which is also good (plenty of drive current for the output transistor's base). You're also amplifying the voltage error and reapplying it to the base of the transistor, effectively counteracting any change in the transistor's operating point.. Hope this helps!

I don't know how the supply side is working out right now, but when the market stabilizes, I can see 2 potential impacts.1) Prices in stores will fall. Once supply catches up, the prices will fall to a more reasonable profit level given the costs of growing. This will impact the demand for the street dealers (when someone can get it just as cheap/cheaper by going to a store, why bother with a dealer?).2) Prices at dealers will rise. If the demand for storefront cannabis is high enough, the suppliers (not the dealers) will start selling their crop directly to the stores. It's better legally, they can move more, and they can probably offer higher prices (if they're selling at higher rates). Because of that, the dealers will have to start buying at higher prices and therefor sell at higher prices.

Another possibility is that people are using cannabis to manage their pain instead of opiates. There are many who use opiates for moderate to severe pain only because they have no other legal option, not because they want some dope. Cannabis can fill this void, particularly for neuropathic pain.

http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm>McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.>>Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.>>Plaintiffs' expert, a scholar in thermodynamics applied to human skin burns, testified that liquids, at 180 degrees, will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds. Other testimony showed that as the temperature decreases toward 155 degrees, the extent of the burn relative to that temperature decreases exponentially. Thus, if Liebeck's spill had involved coffee at 155 degrees, the liquid would have cooled and given her time to avoid a serious burn.">"Post-verdict investigation found that the temperature of coffee at the local Albuquerque McDonalds had dropped to 158 degrees fahrenheit."

Well, the reason weed IS a gateway drug, is because it is illegal. The people you have to get it from may have other things for you to be curious about. If the government sold me pot, I wouldn't even have access to any other ones, without a hook up. Despite all of this, I'm pretty sure that even if I had never tried pot, I would have tried *something*

If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear Him who, after He has killed, has power to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, fear Him!Christians are called to give their whole life to Christ. That means love your neighbor AND follow God's commandments. How loving is it to affirm a person's sin? Is it better to comfort someone in their sin by telling them a lie and lead them to hell, or tell them the whole truth of the gospel, that Jesus saves people from sin, not in sin. The spirit of the gospels is that Jesus transforms people. He gives people faith and then His Spirit. Christians sin, but always turn to God in repentance. A Christian cannot make their Jesus the one that only says "God so loved the world...", and "Judge not..." and reject scriptural teaching that fornication is evil and substance abuse leads to sin.I'm not saying Christians need to lobby for laws against homosexuality, fornication, and marijuana... but Christians should care about these sins in their friends and family around them. Sin destroys lives and will be judged. Either lay your sins on the savior Jesus, or pay the price yourself.

Not necessarily a roommate from hell story but my luck with roommates has been pretty bad. My first roommate was arrested for selling marijuana and kicked out of school.The second roommate had social anxiety and dropped out three months after we started living together. He never left the room except for class and never had friends over.The third was supposed to move in a week ago but had an accident while on his way and has been in the hospital since then.All of this and I'm only a freshman in college. I think I might be cursed.

The Devil must have told you that you need it, now go to jail. That's how they think about it.There are other people against it who have other reasons, but for the most part, it comes from the idea to dictate morality to others. And that's just how humanity is. People often do it not because they actually believe in the moral system that they choose to follow, but more so to make themselves feel morally adjusted by attacking perceived immorality.**And they make a majority of the conservative base. They will never allow a hemp thing to come from Trump without backlash. It will have to come from the legislature.**

Kurdish territory spans several countries, and in all but the remote areas there are also other ethnic groups. For the US, the most important area the Kurds claim is in Turkey. The Turks have been brutal to the Kurds for many years now&mdash; mass arrests, repression, collective punishment, torture, assassinations, and denial of basic rights. If the Kurds get their own country it's likely only a matter of time before they are at war with Turkey, which is a member of NATO. The Kurds were strong US allies in both the Iraq War and the fight against ISIL, so not only does the US military not want to choose between two allies, but the current Turkish dictatorship are scum fucks, and sending American troops to go kill friends on behalf of a tin pot dictator would be very demoralizing.

Yeah that's actually an urban myth. It's illegal because of hemp. In the 30's hemp began to be used for industrial purposes such has paper. William Randolph Hearst owned a very large paper mill, as well as a newspaper. Knowing that the hemp industry would potentially cost him billions he lobbied to make both hemp, the male plant, and cannabis, the female plant illegal. He used his newspaper as a way to spread disinformation about the plants he called "Marijuana." Marijuana originally was actually slang for Mexican wild tobacco, that the media began labeling cannabis as.

To be clear, I am pro legalization and have partaken in quite a heavy amount of use myself. I wouldn't say "complete lack of motivation", but I've definitely seen close friends become less motivated due to marijuana use. And I have seen my own motivation decrease as a result of my own use. You might say there is no way to prove the loss of motivation comes from marijuana use, and you wouldn't be wrong. But I'm quite certain there has been enough correlation between my level of use and amount of motivation through different periods of my life to point towards causation.

see. i’m not even going to read your entire response because from the very first part it’s clear that you’re making assumptions. i never gave my position about prison sentences. i never mentioned what i would do if i were in a position of power. i believe all i’ve really talked about here is the general idea that the freedom to make bad decisions isn’t a good thing, one of those bad decisions *can* include abusing drugs like marijuana. you have no choice but to make assumptions because in your emotional state you want to believe i’m “evil”. if i’m “evil”, then i’m “wrong”. and if i’m “wrong” then you’re “right”.. that makes you feel good inside so why would you take the chance to actually understand my positions when you can feel immediate gratification through your assumptions??

I was walking home one day when I saw some smoke pouring out the front entrance of my neighbor's house. The door was wide open, and I heard voices laughing, so I ventured in to see what was going on. My neighbor and two of his buddies were smoking pot in the living room, so I walked in and said they had two choices: one, they could put the joint out, or two, I could put the joint out for them. My neighbor jumped up and told me to fuck off while I was walking away, so I turned around and said "let's get high". I did a backflip and kicked him in the stomach, and his head hit the ceiling where he fell back to the ground and collapsed. One of the other guys ran into the kitchen where he hid in the corner and started crying. I grabbed a frying pan and said "this is your brain" then said "and this is your brain on drugs" and I hit him in the head with the pan. He was dead in an instant. I found some rope and tied up the other guy for the cops. They came by and cleaned up the mess, and I went home and played Xbox. I don't regret what I did for one second. This was back before pot had been legalized in Colorado.

The Liberal party is left of center on the political spectrum; the Conservative party is right-wing. The Liberals are generally left-wing on social issues, like legalizing marijuana, supporting gay marriage, supporting abortion rights, etc. They are also more centre/left on economics and budget. Not as socialist as the NDP but far more so than the Conservatives. The Conservatives on the other hand are right-wing, fiscally conservative, in favour of lower taxes, support strong military, and fewer restrictions on environmental protection. And they're [unofficially] socially conservative on issues like abortion, gay marriage, etc.

He's Catholic, not that that's much better. And he keeps his religion separate from his politics from what I can tell - advocating for women's rights, LGBT rights, legalization of marijuana, etc.Plus as far as I know the Catholic faith is not mutually exclusive with believing in evolution as the origin of the species, but with the caveat that god invented the soul"Pope Pius XII declared that "the teaching authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions . . . take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter—[but] the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God" (Pius XII, Humani Generis 36)."

The vast majority of Americans do not understand their own personal finance, much less the economics involved with trying to reverse a depression. They say tax cuts because that's what the talking heads say. Tax cuts don't amount to any significant net effect on the middle class individual:Rough Math- say Joe Blow makes 50k a year, of which he pays 33% in payroll tax. This leaves him with 33.3k net, assuming he gets no refund. Let's now suppose that the government reduces his tax burden to 25% (which is a 25% reduction of his current tax liability, in this simplistic example... 25% is a big enough number to make people hoot with pleasure). This gives him a net take home of 37.5k, or a gain of 4.2k/year or about $350 a month. Super. Who wouldn't like to have an extra $350 a month? Except that money most probably will not go into economy stimulating expenditures. The psychology of a recession suggests that people will either save that money or use it to pay down personal debt until the economy recovers. In the mean time, let's say that cut goes to 100M people. That's 420B collectively the government did not collect, and 420B the government could have used to try to create more jobs, which *would* stimulate the economy. Even if it's only a temporary job creation, as some republicans complain, it won't matter, since once the economy is strong again, long term jobs get created once again. This, also, does not take into account the higher marginal tax rate on the wealthy and the amount of revenue lost there. Obviously, tax cuts are significantly more impactful to a rich person than a middle class person, but even then, you have the **fundamental flaw** of trickle down economics: rich people collect wealth. They are not interested in spending it, they are interested in having more of it. It's not that far removed from Scrooge McDuck's money bin. Rich people do *not* spend more money once they have gotten to a certain level of wealth. They spend what they would have spent anyway, and everything else just goes in the bank. When the economy is turning downward, the instinct of the people is to horde their money, and cut out all non-critical expenditures. This will not change until the economy "improves". Giving non-wealthy people money won't entice them to spend, and giving rich people *more* money won't entice them to spend any more. However, giving an unemployed person a job WILL create a new source of spending, since the unemployed person will now by food and clothing on their own instead of either not buying at all, or getting the money to do so from the social welfare system. In addition to the new source of spend, the nation gets enhancements to road and bridge infrastructure, telecommunications hardware, etc. These things all require unskilled labor to do... that's the point. Take the unemployed off the dole, and give them a *taxable* job, which pumps money back into the economy.Also, decriminalize marijuana, so that massive, unfettered cash crop can finally start attributing its revenue in a useful way.

I suffer from bad anxeity and can't work because of it and have had a lot of the same symptoms you're having. Severe anxiety can cause acid build up in your stomach and cause unusual bowel movements so I don't think you have anything you used to worry about there. I used to smoke weed as well and have found that different strains cause the body to react differently in people with anxiety. There are 2 main strains. One will cause worse anxiety and pannic attacks and the other will help. If you live somewhere where it's legal or have a reliable dealer I would highly recommend looking further into this and sticking to the "safe" strain. I can't remember more of the top of my head and my phone is about to die but I hope what little I could offer helped.

I'm a defense attorney who represents parents who have the children removed from their care. I don't represent child abusers. I represent you, people like you, your friends, family. The department of children and family services detains children from their families for things that are not considered abuse by a majority of the country. Children are being adopted away from families that have done nothing more then smoked marijuana. Fathers are losing custody of their children to adoption just because they were unable to sign the birth certificate because a social worker removed the baby at birth due to the baby tested positive for drugs, unbeknownst to the father. The system is destroying families in order to create new families. Something needs to be done. But many legislatures wouldn't touch this issue with a ten foot pole.

"damp cardboard" a bit too much of an umbrella term for a proper calculation.The type of cardboard can vary the amount of water it can hold by probably an order of magnitude (think about how many ways the paper can be folded in the layers, depending on what features the manufacturer is after).If you're talking about [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Corrugated_Cardboard.JPG), my gut feeling is that it wouldn't be sustainable.Here's a quick experiment you can make: soak a large amount of it in water, (a REALLY large amount, you need your sample to be overwhelmingly big to make losses nearly negligible) then squeeze out/evaporate all the water in order to collect it. Pour it into a large pot and use the dried up cardboard as fuel in an attempt to turn it into vapor.If in the end the water's gone and there's still enough heat left to kickstart a new fire, you just invented a cheap way to extract energy from wet organic waste.You could do it by trying to burn wet cardboard too, but you'd need a far larger amount of cardboardEDIT: added last sentence

all I know is they have to have probable cause or driver's consent to search the car. If you deny them the clearance (simply say, "I do not consent to any searches" at any mention of the cop entering your vehicle) to search your car and they can't find any probable cause (even something as stupid as red eye or smell) then they can still call in a K9 unit for backup. At this point ask the cop if you are being detained, you most likely are, but if he says no then you are free to go. If you do have to stay around for the dog to show up, it is legally allowed to sniff around the car, he will most likely pick up your weed giving probable cause to search your car and then you are most likely screwed.

Yep. If we cut our military spending in half, we could afford universal healthcare, and get substantially closer to universal college (which could be helped by increasing taxes on the ultra-wealthy and legalizing marijuana).Note: Cutting military spending alone cannot fund universal healthcare. It is merely a stepping stone towards affording it. We must also increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy, raise the estate tax, tie the gas tax to inflation, etc.

"Local law enforcement agencies rely heavily on the drug war for funding. Police departments are often able to keep a large portion of the assets they seize during drug raids, even if charges are never brought. And federal grants for drug war operations make up a sizable portion of local law enforcement funding."The real reason marijuana is still illegal. Money.

Look, it really is very simple. If you infringe on a human right then it is criminal; if not then not. I have a right to freedom, the law against weed infringes on that right. Every human right comes at the expense of a freedom. In exchange for the right to not be stolen from you give up the freedom to steal; in exchange for the right to not be assaulted you give up the freedom to assault, in exchange for the right to have sex with anyone you like you give up the freedom of denying another their choice (obviously necessitating mutual consent), in exchange for the right to speak you give up the freedom to gag another, etc. Every actual right we have follows this simple formula (life is not a right, we all eventually lose it, but defending it IS a right). And laws exist to protect our rights, otherwise they are not valid. What right does the law against weed protect?

The law that applies to situations where state and federal laws disagree is called the supremacy clause, which is part of article VI of the Constitution. The supremacy clause contains what’s known as the doctrine of pre-emption, which says that the federal government wins in the case of conflicting legislation. Basically, if a federal and state law contradict, then when you’re in the state you can follow the state law, but the feds can decide to stop you. When there is a conflict between a state law and federal law, it is the federal law that prevails. For example, if a federal regulation prohibits the use of medical marijuana, but a state regulation allows it, the federal law prevails.

There are people in the world, although perhaps a small minority, who will stand up for any argument that they see correct and attack any argument they see as wrong, regardless of their opinion on the outcome of the argument. If you cannot identify with these people, it simply means that you are one of the majority, who cannot evaluate an argument based on merit but who can only look at outcomes. It makes you likely a part of the population who shouts "YES!" when any argument is made that supports your point of view, without considering the merits of the argument.Of course everyone is influenced by their emotions and we all use motivated reasoning, but the fact that you think it's impossible for someone to defend a practice unless they take part in that practice is absolutely pathetic and stupid.And for what it's worth, I absolutely *hate* the phrase "I could give a crap" and never use it, and yet have defended it on this page. But this is a minor issue; it's unfortunate that your way of thinking pervades every issue, and often is used to invalidate (in the mind of the foolish person) minority opinions. (The only people who want pot legalized are potheads, for example-- clearly not true, but definitely a major reason that many are not willing to even listen to the arguments presented by legalization proponents.)So please get that foolish notion out of your head, and begin trying to evaluate arguments based on merit-- and unless the other person has expressly presented their opinion to you, please stop assuming that just because they point out weaknesses or strengths in an argument, you can assume you know their point of view.

It's not a misdemeanor, it's a civil offense like a speeding violation or parking ticket. A misdemeanor is a criminal offense.>Both possession and cultivation of the drug still would be against the law, but minor offenses would be treated as civil infractions similar to traffic violations. Those in violation could be fined — but not arrested or jailed — and they would have no criminal record.[source](http://bangordailynews.com/2011/03/17/politics/bills-would-decriminalize-pot-increase-penalties-for-cocaine/)

>It most often just means that instead of a felony, drug use and possession charges are a **civil infraction** instead of a felony **or misdemeanor.**Just a minor correction. A misdemeanor is still a crime. If you decriminalize something, then it typically means that it's a civil infraction. And therefore you can't get arrested for it. This is similar to how Maine was with marijuana until the recent vote. Up until this recent election, possessing under a certain amount of marijuana was civil. So that meant that you could never actually get arrested for possession, even if you get caught every single day with that amount. If something is a misdemeanor, it's still a crime and you can still get arrested for it.

Super short list because I was bored, hardly does anyone any justice:*Christianity: Jesus is God and died on the Cross for your sins. Protestant: You must seek forgiveness and God will provide it. Also you can read and interpret the Bible on your own. Catholic: God decides to forgive you for your sins, you cannot. Also, the Church as a holy institution interprets things.*Atheism: No god. Variations of this.*Islam: Allah gave to the Prophet Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him) a special revelation that is not corrupt unlike previous versions. Follow the Pillars of Islam.*Buddhism: All life is Suffering, the Buddha laid out a path to escape endless reincarnation.*Judaism: Covenantal faithfulness to God and community via ritual and shared culture.*Hinduism: Many variations. Many/One/None gods/goddess may/may not ordain rituals and practices that lead to a variety of goals the ultimate one being to escape the cycle of rebirth.*Pagan: Again to many to shorten. Many gods/goddess who are worshiped in accordance to tradition and inspiration. Honor the Earth.*Rastafarian: Haile Selassie I was God, ie Second Coming of Christ. Reject Western society, cannabis is a divine gift for mediation.*Agnostic: Maybe a god.*Native American: Varies. Many gods/goddess and a focus on traditional places over time and events.*Mormonism: Joseph Smith found a new New Testament that teaches family and community importance and a strong moral code.*Baha'i: Bahaullah was given a unique revelation after Islam that was the most current. Humanity will evolve to spiritual perfection someday.

Absolutely. Trump didn't really bite on abortion, gay marriage, or abstinence education - all 'red meat' issues to evangelicals. Yeah, Pence is a fundie but Trump has to capitulate to that faction of his party, that's just good politics. Pence is actually a very smart choice as assisination / impeachment insurance. (Liberals hate Trump but Pence is actually a progressive nightmare. What democratic would want to get trump out of office just to put Pence in the oval office?) Look at what happened to Clinton when she tried to pull her 'who else are they going to vote for' too many times and didn't really throw any bones to progressives (she didn't even talk about marijuana legalization). We'll see, if Trump pivots towards feckless Christians I'll probably stop supporting him. But if the appointments do well in their positions, more power to them. But Trump hasn't appointed Huckabee to anything so that's favorable. And Trump can't take on the evangelicans and the neocons at the same time, and I agree that neocons need to GTFO Washington.

23 here and on a very similar path. Just make sure you go out and do other activities related to shared or personal interests. If you find yourself staying at home and never deviating from heading back and forth between work/home, then you may want to look for interesting opportunities to socialize or experience new things. (without drinking or smoking of course)I get invited to parties multiple times a week, asked to smoke weed daily (just legalized here in WA), and I'm not interested in any of it. I'm finishing my degree and enjoying learning and experiencing new things every day with a clear mind. I know a lot of people who drink every weekend (or multiple) times a week and they're some of the most boring people I've ever met. They do the same things every week and never stray from what's comfortable for them. They think they're living it up, but as a sober observer, and friend, I've just had to let them go.

People always talk about her level 3 spike but she's strong level 1 too. Prep the first wave so that your Q hits the enemy as you clear it. When people see all 3 melee die they get paranoid and back off so I usually sacrifice one Q proc for a minion and land the rest on enemy. Remember you can auto during Q so easy thunder proc and enemy pops a pot.Obviously level 3 is important. Go for it when they last hit for easy W but if you fuck it up a few times they catch onto your strategy. Mix and match combo if you can't land W against good opponent.Pay attention to where you're putting worked ground. Start on the opposite side of enemy jungler so you don't have to stand near their ganking bush for full Q once they clear second buff. Don't be afraid to chuck Q at enemy on worked ground ... Not all harass has to be a full Q, save that for kill combos or punishes and banks.When you are level 6 ... You know what to do. :)

The OKRT-10 chip is a variable voltage, regulated mod. You usually adjust a pot wheel from 3.3V - 6V.If you know your coil resistance, and you should, you can easily calculate wattage based on voltage. Ohm's Law calculations for wattage is just P(ower) = V(oltage) * V(oltage) / R(esistance).So if you have a 1 ohm coil, at 4volts you're getting 16 W of power (4 * 4 / 1). If you have a 0.5 ohm coil, at 5 volts you're getting 50 watts of power (5 * 5 / .5). Pretty simple.

For sure drunk driving is worse than high driving. All I am saying is that there is an obvious way to combat drunk driving: roadchecks. You drive drunk, cops make you take a breathalyzer test, and you're not driving any more for a while. As far as I know, no such technology exists for marijuana, so driving high would be an undetectable crime, and I'm sure you see the problem with an undetectable crime.

You said you agree that it's fair for the health risk to be used as a reason against cannabis legalization. And then you said the same health risk should also be applied to alcohol and tobacco. Then you said that you don't believe alcohol and tobacco aren't being scrutinized in the same way. What's I'm saying is that they aren't being scrutinized in the same way because there isn't a debate about whether they should be legal or not -- they already are legal. Why would alcohol and tobacco both be scrutinized as though they were being considered for legalization? The fact is they won't be because they are already legal. Despite all the damage both alcohol and tobacco can cause, the public has already accepted them as being suitable for legally obtainable substances. The same can't be said about cannabis. Legal and illegal drugs aren't going to be treated the same and why should they? No one needs to make the case for legalizing either of them. The only scrutiny applied to alcohol and tobacco is in order to minimize the potential risk. Cannabis is not only be scrutiniZed for potential risk if it were legalized, it's also being scrutinized over whether the health risk allow for it to be legalized. You said alcohol and tobacco should be treated the same way as cannabis. Why? As I see it they are in two distinct groups.

T sounds like a very mentally fucked up serial offender and got what he deserves. People going to jail for weed? That's just bullshit in terms of law enforcement, but society is probably better off with people like your friend behind bars for the rest of his life.

Almost no marijuana case goes to trial. You'll almost always plead guilty.The reason you plead guilty is because your defense lawyer knows you'll lose. To convict on marijuana possession, all you need to prove is that the person had the weed on their person. They don't even need to have known it was there. The mere fact that the cops found it on you proves the entire case.If I were a public defender or a defense attorney (I'm a law student), I would tell my client to plead guilty to get favorable treatment. If you go to trial, you'll get a much harsher fine/sentence.

Welcome to Washington, where pot is legal, and you can go to many stores and buy it just like beer and wine. You can only buy 1oz. at a time, but really, that should be plenty for the day.

I've gone through a lot of weed trying to figure out the answer to this question, and I'm pretty sure I know the answer.It really boils down to which of these sentences sound less bizarre to you:* The first chicken came out of an egg that was not a chicken egg.* The first chicken egg came out of an animal that was not a chicken.One of them had to happen, and they both seem ridiculous. I think the latter sounds less so. Because of this, I'm going with the egg came first.So the first chicken came out of a chicken egg, but the bird that laid that egg must have been something other than a chicken.

Right. Should we also allow companies to fire or discriminate against hiring employees who take other prescription medication, or who vote a certain way, or who drink alcohol outside of work? All of those don't affect an employees performance while on the job and workers are protected against that kind of discrimination. Why shouldn't they be protected from marijuana use outside of work if its legal? Just because it can be tested for easily and cheaply and it stays in your system for 30+ days?

This lane is not that bad for Vlad actually. It's all in how you play/build him. Many people run defensive or hybrid offense/def masteries, maybe build Spirit Visage as a second item and mostly just play passively and try to farm until level 9. While this is optimal for Vlad in many situations, if you do that against Swain, you will lose hard.The trick to win this lane (and a many other Vlad "counters") is you have to be incredibly aggressive from lvl 1 and remain that way all game. You must take full offense 21/9/0 masteries, and you must poke Swain constantly. Yes he outranges you but only by very thin margin of 25 and you can typically clear that no problem. He has longer CD's and lower base damage on everything and most importantly is mana hungry even with his passive, so if you go at him early and hard you will drain him of mana and life and win.Start Rejuv bead, 5pots, ward or Doran's Shield/pot. Doran's shield is good for cost effeciency and the extra survivability, but the ward start is nice b/c you are going to be super aggressive early on so it's a hard choice. If he goes Doran's ring start you will crush him, if he goes flask start you will have a harder time but should still have the edge. Move speed quints are good for this matchup and I've also recently become a huge fan of hp/5 quints on Vlad as they make Vlad very strong in the 1-6 stage allowing you to make "bad" trades and still come out ahead. flat hp yellows/ flat magic resist blues/ flat mpen reds. If you play aggressive you will easily burn Swain out of mana and crush him pre-6 and remain ahead of him all game. His waveclear is way weaker than yours. Punish him with Tides while simultaneously pushing your lane hard and he will be forced to burn nevermore to clear or lose cs to tower. Then you can ward aggressively (easy to do once you are ahead) at the enemies blue and coordinate with your jungle to keep swain away from Blue buff. Even if he gets blue though, if you are ahead enough it won't make a difference.Once you are ahead don't build defensive at all (at leat not until late game), rush all damage, Wota>Sorc>Morellonomicon>Rabadons. (Yes go full Wota early, you need the extra spell vamp and cdr to outrade/outsustain swain) Morellonomicon will put you at 35% cdr giving you even more poke and sustain, is gold effecient even without using the mana regen, is super cheap at 2200g and most importantly give you Grevious Wounds debuff for burning Swain down. If you get out ahead of Swain before 6 it becomes very easy to hold him down all game. With out items his waveclear is rather slow which will push him even further behind.

Yeah. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't read it either."The neonates of heavy-marijuana-using mothers had better scores on autonomic stability, quality of alertness, irritability, and self-regulation and were judged to be more rewarding for caregivers. "They try to suggest other factors give these results - "suggest that the better scores of exposed neonates at 1 month are traceable to the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal development"This means either the effect of Marijuana on unborn children has positive effects or NO negative effects or negative effects so negligible, social-economic factors can overcome them and make them positive. Is it just me or is this big news? Why haven't we heard of this before? This study was done in 1994!

While I don't agree with every drug the USA has illegal (marijuana,) they are still illegal. If someone does something illegal, or has something that is illegal to have, they're going to do some time. That's just how it is. It doesn't make sense to do something you know you could get in trouble for, and then complain when you do get into trouble.

Did you every try out higher doses? How did they work for you if so? Great post, thanks. I just started flmodafinil 100mg daily 4 days ago and it definitely works. So much so that I may decrease the dose. As for other things I take: Ashwagandha KSM-66 300mg daily(for anxiety), fasoracetam 20-40mg twice daily (this upregulates your gabab receptors so you can stay in a constant low anxiety, high social state), usually at least one caffiene+theanine pill if needed, 25mg tianeptine sulfate once or twice daily as needed if I ever need to completely eliminate any depression I may have. Other than that, when I game I like to take 20mg coluracetam as it seems to make me focus and get in the zone much better. You may like some of these, none of them will give you any kind of high except tianeptine if you do doses over 100mg but I highly recommend not doing that.

The crime she committed is irrelevant. She was raped and no crime big or small warrants that action. She was not raped because she had the marijuana. These are separate events and one is not causal for the other. It would be just as bad if she was incarcerated for absolutely no crime or if she had just murdered someone. It's irrelevant because they did not cause the rape. It's not karma.

> This is such a simplistic interpretation of what I've said. Conversation allows us to decide together whether we want to change our minds. The killing of people is a moral action in itself. It would be immoral to do that act, but yes it would end up shifting views. But conversation doesn't force people to change their views, it merely exposes them to other possibilities. Some people find this dangerous, and I can see why.Again it's becoming clear that the issue isn't act (like murder) vs. non-act (conversation). It's becoming clear that the issue is whether you harm people, or force people, or coerce people, or other sorts of classic morally bad things. Although your original comment that started this conversation was about how art can't be limited by morality because art is expression and society is repression, it turns out what you really think is going on is that art is morally fine because it doesn't hurt or coerce or force anyone. That's not a strange viewpoint but I hope you'll realize that you can endorse it without saying *anything* about whether morality is repression or society is repression or any of that stuff. You can just say "it's okay to do whatever you'd like so long as you don't hurt anyone.">You only say this because you believe cannabis use is not immoral. But you only came to this conclusion through discussion, or through society's discussion.How do you know how I came to my conclusion? What if I came to the conclusion because someone beat me with a pipe until I agreed, or threatened to kill my family unless I agreed?>Not without severe consequence. A legal order is more or less coercion; it's forced.Only if the police will punish you for not following the order! And that only works if the police listen to orders!>What? The sentence you quoted were perhaps philosophical claims, but not moral ones.Morality is a branch of philosophy!>I am telling you what I think, not what my society thinks.But to figure out if you're right, we have to find out what your society thinks, right? Because a moral claim can't be objectively right or wrong. It can only be right or wrong in a society. Right?>Why do you assume everyone agrees that? I don't. I'm certainly not alone. There are so many factors neglected here it's not even funny.That's just an example. You don't have to literally agree with that particular principle. The point is that some disagreements that look like they're moral disagreements actually are based on *agreement* on a moral principle and disagreement about a *non-moral* principle. In the example both sides agree with that principle. Obviously you don't have to agree with the example. It's just an example.>Overall, the only thing I gathered from that post was that we don't have an answer. We might as well stop discussing this, as we don't even agree on fundamental definitions of morality.Notice that earlier in this post I pointed out that we *can* stop discussing this because it's actually irrelevant to your argument: your argument is just that it's okay to make any art you want as long as you don't harm/coerce/force anyone.>Consequently, all moral discussion is exempt from moral critique because you only arrive at a standard through discussion.We arrive at moral standards through other means too, like murder. Does that mean murder is exempt from moral critique?

Not even a marijuana user myself, and still I can tell the current system with regards to it is broken. It's absolutely ridiculous to me that marijuana is illegal and demonized while tobacco and alcohol are legal and socially acceptable.

I don't care what your high on. You shouldn't be high, talking on the phone, distracted in any way whatsoever while driving a car. Driving high on pot is illegal for a reason it does impair your driving. You are just making assumptions about what I know personally or don't but this is irrelevant to the discussion... the fact is that being high impairs your driving.

You have to give consent for them to search your car. If an officer says "I'm searching your vehicle," you can and should refuse them if you don't want your car searched. You are in *no way* obligated to allow them to search your car, and they don't have the right to do so.The only time an officer can search your car without your permission is if they have "probable cause." For example, if you get pulled over because the cop saw you hitting a bowl, he's justified in assuming that you have weed in your car, and is allowed to search it. The officer has to record what the probable cause was, and justify it in court if it gets there.

Attorney General Eric Holder said at a press conference Wednesday that the Justice Department will no longer raid medical marijuana clubs that are established legally under state law. His declaration is a fulfillment of a campaign promise by President Barack Obama, and marks a major shift from the previous administration.After the inauguration, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) continued to carry out such raids, despite Obama’s promise. Holder was asked if those raids represented American policy going forward.“No,” he said. “What the president said during the campaign, you’ll be surprised to know, will be consistent with what we’ll be doing in law enforcement. He was my boss during the campaign. He is formally and technically and by law my boss now. What he said during the campaign is now American policy.”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/26/holder-vows-to-end-raids_n_170119.html

>Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.>[Source](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana)Edit: Pretty much, everyone is divided on the subject, but I can't imagine that carcinogens are exactly good for you...

heh. i wanted to kill myself when i worked for mcdonalds a few years back. the store i was at was awful and my parents would not let me quit. I got the job when i was 16 and it was loads of fun. i was working with people who were fun and cool to be around, which makes all the difference when every customer you have to interact with thinks that you are half retarded or at the very least not worth even the slightest bit of courtesy. anyways, over the next year every friend i had at mcdonalds eventually quit or went off to college. the store ended up hiring a fuckton of inner city kids (read black) who followed just about every stereotype there is. by the time i was 18, i was still working there (having failed at finding another part time minimum wage job. wtf?), surrounded by completely incompetent workers who smoked weed, fucked in the breakroom, and were generally lazy as fucking shit. we were perpetually understaffed and lost the people who were hired after a week or two. I had to do 9-10 hour shifts without breaks (as a minor, no less) while still in school most days of the week. It was apparently more profitable for mcdonalds to violate the child labor laws and take a fine than to close the store due to understaffing. Usually i had to work 2 or 3 different jobs at a time after 10pm, like take the orders, make the order, hand it out the window (should be 3 people). sometimes it would be just me and a manager working there for 4 hours straight. i was still only paid minimum wage. when i quit, i could see the fear in the manager's eyes. lots of people think "this place would fall apart if it weren't for me" but in my case, it was true. corporate mcdonalds replaced the entire management staff, and had the place staffed with full time salary employees for a couple months while they got their shit together. i literally was saving the corporation thousands upon thousands of dollars by just being employed and reliable.tl;drshit sucked, i was the only employee who did any work. Had shit shifts while customers treated employees as subhuman. it was perpetually understaffed. when i quit, store went to hell.

Currently, only CO, OR, WA and AK have shops where any adult (21+) can walk in off the street and buy weed in a store.MA, CA, DC, ME, and NV just legalized recreational pot, but don't currently have the infrastructure in place for legal shops. So they are in this weird gray area right now, where it is technically legal to possess it, but there is no *legal* means of acquiring it, other than from someone "gifting" it to you.San Fran is a great city, and it is really easy to find weed. Last time I was in the Bay Area, I just asked a Hippie in the Haight, and he rolled me few joints. It is pretty out in the open.You could also simply start in one of the cities (Portland, Seattle) with legal weed and buy a little extra to take with you to other places.

Generally nasus will go sustain and farm my lane forever tactics. A good way to deal with nasus on lower elo is to go high lvl2-3 burst champion and just all in nasus once you hit that level. Good example is gankplank, you start with red pot or doran blade and full ad/arm pen runes, go in lane and start harrass with Q + 1-2 autoattacks, by the time you get lvl2 you can just Q + ignite + autoattack till he is dead. And if he throws slow on you, just use your oranges heal since it removes that cc. Some good picks are leesin/riven/fizz. If you go full damage and get first blood lvl1-3, you get item + experience advantage and can just keep on punishing and zoning nasus out of farm.

Not defending Liza here (kasi nag feeling attackes siya agad), pero naman kasi, those critics could have said it better without having her feel attacked, nagalit naman din tayo nung yung Koreano sa PGT was humiliated diba? then started sharing videos of foreigners of what's it like to be Filipino....nakakainis lang kasi ang hypocrito nung iba eh, masyado maraming entitled na kala their opinion is the only one that matters..

Depending on the dose the come up can be kind of annoying effects wise. I tend to get the shakes pretty bad, and my body has a hard time regulating my temperature. Lots of putting on/off different jackets and blankets.Otherwise, during the actual trip I've found it wonderful and very easy to deal with. The headspace is definitely psychedelic in nature, but it's very forgiving and manageable. Depending on the dose, it's sometimes underwhelming mentally, so I usually throw in some weed or a dissociative to make it more interesting mentally.Visually speaking though, it's one of the best compounds I've had the pleasure of trying.It's really quite special IMO, as it can be used for a fantastic recreational experience, or it can be used for a deep therapeutic experience, depending on dose, set/setting, etc.

I would prefer that people who support marijuana legalization simply go ahead and support marijuana legalization. It's disingenuous and off-putting to mask support of marijuana legalization with support of industrial hemp.

Is it related to pot? My guess is probably not, but it is just my guess. Colorado legalization and deaths do not seem correlated at all. Wasn't it legalized around 2013? Here are the last 9 years in Colorado, total fatalities,Colorado 2008: 548 deaths, 2009: 465 deaths, 2010: 450 deaths, 2011: 447 deaths, 2012: 474 deaths, 2013: 481 deaths, 2014: 488 deaths, 2015: 547 deaths, 2016 so far: 572 deaths Source CDOT

Ergo while he is not physically the same person as Obama, his actions in the context of his role as Attorney General are officially Obama's actions.

To be clear the court is provincial but he is fighting federal law.Even if he wins and, his evidence is more than ample enough to win we will still have to wait for the appeal from the supreme court of Canada.Court decision dates are not the same as hearing dates, it will not be on May 7 and 8th that we will even get a decision that is when his HEARING is.

Ha, sorry that when I research a subject I don't source everything in case I run into someone on the internet who doesn't want to do their own research but yet still wants to yell at me. But here's a couple.....>Clinical studies have given contradictory reports on the effect of smoking marijuana on the plasma levels of testosterone in males. A **reanalysis of existing data established that testosterone levels are depressed both after smoking one marijuana cigarette** and after intravenous infusion of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, a pharmacologically active component of marijuana. Simulation of the marijuana interaction, under the assumption that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol **inhibits testosterone production or secretion, suggests a minimum of 24 hours are required for testosterone to return to pre-smoking levels**. A series of clinical studies are specified to clarify the nature of the interaction. - *"Effects of marijuana on testosterone in male subjects.Barnett G, Chiang CW, Licko V."*...>THC had a **significant effect on spermatogenesis and decreased the number of all germinal cells**. - "Interactive effects of chronic phencyclidine and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol on spermatogenesis in mice"...>During chronic exposure to THC the pharmacokinetic molecular mechanisms which limit the storage of THC in the brain and testis are not sufficient to prevent a persistent deregulation of membrane signalling and the induction of functional and morphological changes which reflect a **premature apoptosis of spermatogenic cells**. Long term, longitudinal epidemiological studies have reported **decreased spermatogenesis in healthy, fertile adult males**. - *"Pharmacokinetics of THC in brain and testis, male gametotoxicity and premature apoptosis of spermatozoa"*...>Testosterone 6β- and 16a-hydroxylase activities together with androstenedione formation from **testosterone in rat liver microsomes were also significantly inhibited by the crude marijuana extracts and the cannabinoids**. Crude marijuana extracts (1 and 10 μg/ml) of THCA strain stimulated the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, although the purified cannabinoids (THC, CBD and CBN) did not show significant effects, such as the extract at the concentration of 0.01-1000 nM. These results indicate that there are **some metabolic interactions between cannabinoid and steroid metabolism and that the constituents showing estrogen-like activity exist in marijuana**. - *"Marijuana extracts possess the effects like the endocrine disrupting chemicals"*...># It **inhibits the release of a substance in the brain called GnRH**. GnRH normally triggers the pituitary gland to **release two hormones called FSH and LH which cause the testis to make testosterone and to improve sperm production and function**. So **marijuana use can directly lower testosterone levels and impair testicular sperm production**.In a test tube, the active substance in **marijuana THC was shown to impair sperm function and to impair a sperm's ability to fertilize an egg**. - *"http://fertilityspot.com/can-marijuana-use-affect-fertility.html"*...>Recreational Drugs: Marijuana (cannabinoid) often causes a **decrease in average sperm count, motility, and normal morphology, and can affect the HPG axis,(causing decreased plasma testosterone)** as well as have a direct negative effect on the Leydig Cells. - *"Reproductive Biology Associates"*Here are some sources, if you'd like to continue a discussion on marijuana and its affect on your hormones I'm all for it. Until then it's called science shithead, learn to use it. There are sources which claim marijuana does not affect testosterone levels, but there is enough information to suggest that it does, and at the least, disrupts the normal functioning of sexual hormones.

3rd parties can help push the major party platforms toward their goals, though.

Then why is marijuana (and other drugs) illegal?> if the government has some level of control over what's in a cigarette.The government does regulate the sale of cigarettes, but does not regulate what goes into them. In fact, because the government forced all the warning labels and controls, there's pretty much zero regulation on the actual product.

I'm not sure point 2 is an east coast vs. west coast thing. Both coasts tend to vote more progressively on social issues than the middle of the country. For example, the first two states to legalize marijuana were "west coast" if you include Colorado as west coast, but the first two to legalize gay marriage were on the east coast.Also, do you have any references saying that the west coast is more culturally heterogeneous than anywhere else in the US?

In a purely objective sense, weed should be at least schedule 3. And by objective I mean the wording of the actual act.1) **Schedule I.** -(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.(B) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.(C) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.(2) **Schedule II.**(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to *severe* psychological or physical dependence.(3) **Schedule III.** -(A) The drug or other substance has a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to *moderate* or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.(4) **Schedule IV.**(A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to *limited* physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.(5) **Schedule V.**(A) The drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.(C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to *limited* physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule IV.So by my reading, and now subjective view, Alcohol should be schedule 2, aspirin should be schedule 3, caffeine should be schedule 4 and weed schedule 5. As alcohol has no medical value outside of cleaning wounds but has severe affects, aspirin is easy to overdose on, caffeine has limited psychological and physical dependences when abused, and weed as less than caffeine but it could be schedule 4 with it as many would argue one way or the other (but caffeine has no medical value so...). But of course only weed is a controlled substance on that list right now. My real view is weed should be taken completely off the controlled substance act and placed under the authority of the ATF to be regulated like alcohol and tobacco.

>Are they not bound to comply?They 100% are bound to comply. The [supremacy clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) in the Constitution basically says that Federal law trumps State law - states can not ignore, revoke or overrule any law passed by the US Congress that is ruled to be Constitutional.The issue is whether or not the Federal Government chooses to enforce its laws on the states. Take the legalization of marijuana right now - it is still illegal at the federal level, but the Feds are choosing not to enforce the law in states that have made it legal by state statue. The States can't overturn the Federal law - it is still illegal in the state per Congress, but it is just not enforced.For these other laws, it is likely that the Federal Government will choose to enforce the Federal regulation. Time will tell on that.

Does Fox News make them unpleasant or is it that unpleasant people like Fox News?It seems to me that in order to be obsessed over something like Fox News, they have to be the kind of people who like hearing about stuff that they have contempt for, and who don't want to look up the facts or counter-arguments for themselves. Fox News feeds off of those people and those people feed off of Fox News.My grandfather watches Fox News.

No, they wouldn't be released.As of 1999, we had roughly 60,000 people incarcerated for cannabis crimes:*Nearly 60,000 marijuana offenders are incarcerated in the United States at any given time, according to a study published in the Federation of American Scientists' "Drug Policy Analysis Bulletin." More than a quarter of marijuana offenders are incarcerated for personal possession, with no other drugs involved in the offense.*[Source](http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/095/marijuanaprisoners.shtml)At that time we were arresting roughly 700,000 people per year. We are now arresting closer to 800,000. I suspect there has been an increase in the number of marijuana offenders but it's probably less than 70,000.

The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment. “The Rohrabacher–Farr amendment (also known as the Rohrabacher–Blumenauer amendment) is legislation first introduced by U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey in 2001, prohibiting the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws. It passed the House in May 2014 after six previously failed attempts, becoming law in December 2014 as part of an omnibus spending bill.”“The passage of the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment in 2014 was noted for its rare bipartisan support,[32] garnering the approval of 49 Republicans and 170 Democrats.”https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohrabacher–Farr_amendment

There is probably a controler IC. Ive seen uA723 in other [Astron supplies](http://www.repeater-builder.com/astron/astron-index.html). You could put a pot between pins 5 and 6 but you need to be careful. [Cautionary Note](http://www.repeater-builder.com/astron/front-pots/front-pots.html):Astron's fixed-voltage supplies can put out the rated current at the rated voltage. If you reduce the output voltage, the series-pass transistors on the heat sinks will dissipate more power and you could exceed their ratings. For example, with a raw DC voltage of 22 Volts and a regulated output voltage of 14 Volts, the series-pass transistors are dropping 8 Volts. At 30 amps, that's 240 watts. If you reduce the regulated output voltage to 7 Volts, the transistors are now dropping 15 Volts. At 30 amps, that's 450 watts, almost twice the power. That's a lot of heat; neither the transistors nor the heat sink are capable of dissipating that much power. If you reduce the output voltage, you must also reduce the current used by the load.

I don't understand what your point is about the domestic violence example. If you agree that weed probably didn't contribute to the violence, then what are you trying to say in relation to weed? Since you say it's legal to smoke in your house, don't you just treat that situation like any other domestic violence call?

I love this study just for the mere fact it will drive the pot smokers nuts. Why i believe that marijuana should absolutely be legalized and the benefits for legalization for medical purposes are absolutely outstanding, I also love the fact that redditors who loves smoking pot everyday on here are going to lose their marbles over a study like this.because these losers refuse to believe anything negative about the studies of pot.

My husband and I own guns, and we have friends that own guns. Anybody can kill another person with or without a gun. Some people like to use guns for target practice. Some people use them to hunt, and others use them for self-defense. If someone wants to get hold of a gun and shoot up a mall, they'll find a way to do it. Making pot illegal never stopped people from getting it. So why shouldn't responsible gun owners be allowed to have them?

It sounded like really dry wood does when you toss it on a campfire. I also compared it to pop rocks. Really weird. Oh well. I got blazed as shit so the sound of the weed doesn't really matter much. I also don't think I ever expected to write the previous sentence.

World's number one sport and Fox knows nothing about it. Fox has also failed to notice that 23, that is more than half the states have legalized medical marijuana. Our President is clearly better informed than Fox News.

Well we're comparing the statistics to themselves, so unless we have reason to believe that the number of teens lying on these surveys has changed significantly then we can use them to determine relative use. There's also the factor that in the past, teens readily admitted the ease of obtaining marijuana compared to alcohol. With legalization, we would expect them to be more willing to admit to use and availability, causing an apparent rise in use if real use numbers remained the same. That suggests that not only is it decreasing, it's likely to be decreasing more than these numbers would suggest.

I think you meant to ask if we support the death penalty. I find it ironic that jurors judge a person to death for judging a person to death. Isn't that the reason murder is unacceptable? Who are we to decide when someone dies? Well I find it to be a bit of a pot and kettle situation when juries vote for the death penalty. I also don't agree with the death penalty for fiduciary reasons as well. More expensive to kill them than to let live for the rest of their lives.

My city has a local trees Reddit. If you're in a new place check if they have their own, too.Craigslist is pretty reliable where I am, but I live in a city that's pretty chill when it comes to weed even though it isn't technically legal.

Yeah, usually bad situations drive people to do stupid things. The recession, people killed themselves because they lost everything. They could've fixed it themselves, but chose to end it their because of their situation.I got arrested for marijuana and it almost ruined my life. Almost killed myself, but didn't. It all fixed itself in the future.I'm probably talking bullshit, but still

"The fact is today, people don't go to jail for the possession of marijuana," Walters alleged on C-Span. "Finding somebody in jail or prison for possession of marijuana is like finding a unicorn. It doesn't exist."That's our drug czar saying this. Holy shit. I'm pretty sure the average 12 year old knows that our jails are full of marijuana users. A very good personal friend of mine is in jail for possessing medical marijuana. I'll be damned, I know a unicorn.Contact the ONDCP and ask them if this fact is true, then tell them they need to inform their boss.Drug Policy Information ClearinghouseP.O.

Cool, a lot of people are the opposite of that too.

It did: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_that_have_decriminalized_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_StatesBut decriminalization is VERY different from legalization. What decriminalization usually means is that while still illegal, cannabis possession is a civil, not criminal offense. Often amount is important, smaller amounts for personal consumption result in a civil offense (it is like getting a traffic ticket, you forfeit the goods and pay a fine) while possession of larger amounts for apparent distribution can result in criminal charges.

One time I went to a party with my cousin just outside London in England. The party started off fine, just 10-20 people drinking cans/vodka and smoking spliff; standard stuff. Then the girl who was hosting it called her boyfriend, who came over with 20 of his friends. Those friends invited more friends. By about half 11 there were at least 150 people there. In a regular suburban house. The girl who was hosting it got overwhelmed by this and locked herself in her room crying. While this was going on, someone left the shower and the bath on (the bath went through the floor and landed in the living room), kicked in the front door (with £800+ worth of stained glass) and set her couch on fire. We kicked in her bedroom door and she was lying on her bed crying. The police came and kicked everyone out, the most aggressive people were arrested but most of us get away, but then half an hour later we all ended up coming back because the front door had the lock kicked in so she couldn't lock us out. Ended up having a huge rave in her house. All crockery, ornaments etc broken. TV thrown out the 2nd story window. 5 guy brawl resulting in a mirror being broken over a guy's face.TL;DR: Crazy party. Host locks herself in bedroom. Bath goes through ceiling, front door kicked in, police come. Arrests made, we come back, tv thrown out window, mirror smashed over a guy's face.

Really now smoking weed every day is great for the lungs and cures cancer... >Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time. >Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.8 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses. You're wrong and lying... So if you are going to have an opinion on something, please know what you're talking about before you say anything

We were moving into a house around the corner and my brother and I had moved our rooms already. We were upstairs smoking out and heard a knock on the bedroom door. Thinking it was the friend we were waiting on, I got up and opened the door. Two fucking cops staring us down. Room filled with smoke, our eyes glasses, and I notice my brother open the nightstand drawer and gently push the bad of weed in then shut the drawer. Freaking out about now, the cops asked us what we were doing and I told them we just moved in from around the corner. They said OK and left (go figure that one out). We look out the window and there are 12 cop cars outside our house and a helicopter flying over. Had to smoke another one to get over that. The only thing that saved us was that they had entered illegally and knew it.

For one, I think the penalties regarding minors are too stiff. 7 years for passing a joint to a 17 year old, even unknowingly? If an 18 year old gives marijuana to 14 year old, that's another 7 years. Really? I'm not advocating minors smoking weed, but hell, there are no such penalties currently.

Nunu is by far my favorite champion in League of Legends. A well played Nunu is a complete game changer - great teamfight, great objective control, great counterjungling, the whole package. The best way to play Nunu is to counterjungle the SHIT out of your opponent. You can start with a ward and a machete and a pot or 2 and get timers on his buffs, then head there the second they spawn. You're silver so you should easily be able to do this. Then you build full tank and eat as many Big Wraiths/Big Wolves/Big Golems as possible so the enemy team has as little gold income in their jungle as possible. You should be looking to take early dragons/barons as Nunu and Co. Kill Drag/Baron extremely fast, and Nunu's Smite-Q combo is unmatched at taking out an objective. Next is your W, which grants ridiculous Attack Speed and can be used in ganks along with your E slow to get a kill, or to push down towers. My friend and I used to duo Jax/Nunu and one wave at 15~ minutes is sometimes enough to take down a turret. In teamfights your job is to make them kill you and punish them if they don't. Get in the middle of the enemy team, pop your ult, and wait. If you die the channel still goes off and does damage, and if they don't kill you it does damage, so your ult is an amazing tool for zoning the enemy off of your team. Other then that roll faces, throw snowballs, and eat stuff and you're on your way to being a successfull Nunu! Good luck summoner :D

Yeah, the commute kind of sucks but I did it previously for a year and only found a job closer to home because the company I was working for had to close (medical cannabis’s shift to recreational here in Washington). And you nailed it, it’s possible for them to pay below minimum wage because the tribe isn’t subjected to state minimum wage laws, only federal. Federal minimum wage is $7.49 or something and Washington States minimum wage is $11.50, increasing to $12 in January. I plan on asking the commute job for atleast $16/hr but the gas station job was firm on $11 because it’s a big corporation.

"Safe and effective" is a regulatory term (yes, I know) that refers to validation (another regulatory term) of an intended use (another regulatory term).Basically he's saying marijuana has never been approved by the FDA as effective at producing a specific clinical outcome and having the benefit of that outcome outweighing the risk of use*. This is a very narrow statement that sounds very broad. It's also very misleading because NIDA was the only legal source for research marijuana and they would not issue for this purpose.* EDIT: clarified what "intended use" means.

I absolutely think Republicans will become more pro-legalization but it will take time. Social conservatives are really holding the party back in that regard. Social conservatives will be less enthusiastic in their support if they think Republicans are pro-pot and unfortunately Republicans have to rely on those votes to win elections.

They should not be banned but strongly discouraged. Tobacco not so much because it does not cause psychological harm, alcohol is worse, but is alright in moderation, as long as you are not drinking every weekend, it is not so bad. weed is a depressant like alcohol but more addictive and much worse for you, so it is questionable if it should be legal. Homosexuality is worse than any of the others, but it would not be pragmatic to make it illegal, so it should just be strongly discouraged and socially abolished.

Fox News is notorious for the spread of misinformation, and, because of this, I cannot see it as a legitimate news source. However, Fox News and the Fox Business Channel have two shows, Freedom Watch w/ Judge Nopalitano and Stossel w/ John Stossel, and both of these shows often argue for the legalization of marijuana or the end of the drug war. Fox News sucks, but I have to give them credit for tackling the end of the Drug War w/ more reason and effort than CNN, MSNBC, or any other major news network. Biased? Yes. But isn't it nice when Fox is biased on our side?

I don't think that's even close to the hundreds of thousands of people who are thrown in prison for pot-related crimes. They go in as a pothead and walk out a criminal. I'd rather have a hundred thousand more potheads than a hundred thousand more criminals.

You bastard. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas... I’ll bet you couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a dick than be seen with you.You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space.

SexDrugs: The tide is turning. These "tired" arguments are working.This year, in recent polls, a *majority* of Americans finally support marijuana legalization. It's sort of a major turning point for marijuana:http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/record-high-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspxWe finally have majority support in America. Now its time to turn that majority support into supermajority support, which even Congress will eventually have to listen to.

I'm not sure exactly why this poll is so weird, but to call it propaganda in the sense that CNN is trying to whitewash support for marijuana legalization seems off base.The incentive for a news organization, in this case CNN, would not be to report on a poll that largely maintains the status quo opinion but instead in the poll that shows a majority favoring marijuana legalization. In other words, "Majority Still Against Marijuana Legalization" would not be nearly as beneficial in terms of traffic and general buzz as "Majority Supports Marijuana Legalization."This is probably just a case of looking to deep into one poll. CNN does tons of poll I'm sure we could find plenty of them that ask these questions that do it correctly.

> Nope. That Muslims claim that Allah is the same entity as the Christian and Jewish God does not make it so.God is a public domain character that is open to interpretation so there isn't anything to actually prevent anyone from deciding what he is or isn't. "Everyone has their own personal relationship with god."I don't think it's true that Muslims claim they are the same so much as historically, Christianity, Judaism and Islam all branch from the same place. Do you know why they're called Abrahamic religions? >Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are sometimes called Abrahamic religions because they all accept the tradition that God revealed himself to the prophet Abraham. The theological traditions of all Abrahamic religions are thus to some extent influenced by the depiction of the God of Israel in the Hebrew Bible, and the historical development of monotheism in the history of Judaism.>The Abrahamic God in this sense is the conception of God that remains a common attribute of all three traditions. God is conceived of as eternal, omnipotent, omniscient and as the creator of the universe. God is further held to have the properties of holiness, justice, omni-benevolence and omnipresence. Proponents of Abrahamic faiths believe that God is also transcendent, meaning that he is outside space and outside time and therefore not subject to anything within his creation, but at the same time a personal God, involved, listening to prayer and reacting to the actions of his creaturesSo, they collectively have "God" and and the revelation of the prophet Abraham. They all have the story of the Garden of Eden, Jonah, Zacharaia, and more. But they've branched off from this common ground to form their own belief systems. English is still a Germanic language even though it isn't German. >The easiest way to see that the claim is obviously false is to look at what the respective deities demand of their followers.They all demand the same boring things- like being humble, praying, not worshipping other gods and performing good deeds. Outside of that, individual interpretations of each religion are too broad and many to characterize any of these religions wholesale. There are Jews, Muslims and Christains who smoke weed and club and they probably have more in common with each other than orthodox members of their faiths that stay home, pray, and wear weird hats all day.

My apologies for not knowing the name of the country Darfur is in, but African politics has frustrated me so much all my life, that I simply don't read the articles any more.Guerrilla movement performs a half coup, disabling or hindering the official government. Then said Guerrilla group spends next decade stealing the supplies we send for the innocent people of the country.Eventually there will be some peacekeeping force sent in, but it will be much too late, their economy will a shambles. Then we have adverts to adopt pot bellied african kids on TV for another 10 years.That isn't to say they don't have my deepest sympathies. But when I know my government will intervene, regardless of the cash raised by independant charities, using my tax money to pay for it. Then I have little need to donate.Paramountly though, the "Your donation will fund our crucial awareness and advocacy programs" can at best be interpretted as "We'll use your $2500 donation to fly around the country talking to politicians that already know whats going on". There is no reference to direct aid from the donations that I can see. So you're money is going into the wallet of some green peace jack-off that wants to ban steak...

I have no idea. Alabama legalized gay marriage, which I didn't think would happen until it was a federal law. So probably a state that seems like it would legalize it in the very near future will be the last state to legalize marijuana.

EDIT: Here is the PDF I was looking for earlier. http://www.southhadley.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/295Page 1, 2nd question> Are qualifying patients eligible for medical marijuana under the new lawstarting January 1, 2013, while DPH is drafting its regulations?>During the time DPH is crafting its regulations, the ballot measure allows thewritten recommendation of a qualifying patient’s physician to act as a medicalmarijuana registration card. **The law allows a written recommendation to serve asa limited cultivation registration, meaning a qualifying patient may cultivate his orher own limited supply of marijuana during this period.** Under the law, until DPHissues its regulations, it is not involved in regulating any medical marijuanarecommendations between physicians and patients, or in defining the limitedcultivation registration. Even once final regulations are put in place, patients maycontinue to visit physicians for certification, and to possess legally allowableamounts of medical marijuana as defined in the regulations, before DPH’santicipated online registration system is available.DPH will notify the public on its medical marijuana website,www.mass.gov/medicalmarijuana, when this system is operational and must beused. He is correct. Anyone with a REGISTERED card can grow right now. Has been that way since day 1 of 2013http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/quality/medical-marijuana/law-enforcement-guidance.pdf> Until DPH begins to process hardship cultivation applications patients or their caregivers mayconduct limited cultivation at their primary residence, but may only grow a sufficient amount fortheir sixty day supply as certified by the patient’s physician. They must remain in compliancewith all DPH regulations regarding Hardship Cultivation. DPH will announce when applicationsfor Hardship Cultivation Registration will be required for home cultivation.

>McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees. >Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee. >Plaintiffs' expert, a scholar in thermodynamics applied to human skin burns, testified that liquids, at 180 degrees, will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds. Other testimony showed that as the temperature decreases toward 155 degrees, the extent of the burn relative to that temperature decreases exponentially. Thus, if Liebeck's spill had involved coffee at 155 degrees, the liquid would have cooled and given her time to avoid a serious burn.

One night at about 8pm i was smoking a joint and my wife asked me to put the rubbish out. I got up, joint in mouth and put the rubbish bag in the bin in the front garden. As i was turning around to go back inside, two policemen were walking past my house and said "Excuse me sir." At that point i freaked out, bolted for the door and closed it behind me inside the house. Almost immediately they were hammering on the front door. I waited what seemed like ages, but they didn't stop banging on the front door. By this time i'd flushed the joint and thrown my stash of 1/4 of weed over next door's fence. I finally opened the door and they asked me a few questions as to why i hadn't opened the door immediately and what i had been smoking. They said they wanted to come inside, so i asked if they had a warrant, they told me that they didn't need warrant if they suspected a crime was going on. I asked what crime and they said cannabis possession. Again they asked to come inside and i asked if they had a warrant. After a bit of too and fro-ing they went about their business.

Out of scope. I objected to your foundational point: gun bans will lead to "a mass murderer without access to guns."

Medical MJ card information is absolutely, definitely, in a "database". There's a registry for every card and every card user. https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Medial-Marijuana-Identification-Card.aspx> The California Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) Medical Marijuana Identification Card Program (MMICP) was specifically established to create a State-authorized medical marijuana identification card (MMICP), **along with a registry database for verification of qualified patients and their primary caregivers.**They won't share this information with ATF, of course.

It's an infraction for less than like 1/4 or something now. We now have medical marijuana licenses, but it's only a ticket for getting caught with a certain amount or less. I don't smoke so I don't pay attention to the actual numbers, but it is only a ticket now for that amount or less. It is considered decriminalized for that amount, and I guess it's the same as it doesn't make you a criminal to get a speeding ticket.

I don't think they're confused at all. Look at the [exit polls](http://abcnews.go.com/politics/elections/National/exitpolls). The important issues in this election were the economy, health care and foreign policy. Right now, voters trust Republicans on those issues.Minimum wage, marijuana and abortion just aren't that high on the list. It's not news that most Americans side with Democrats on minimum wage, and an outright ban on abortions, even if it's blatantly unconstitutional, is still too extreme. Also, marijuana may be a liberal issue, but it's not an issue for the Democratic Party at the national level.The problem is that you can't put the economy on a ballot measure. There are some economic issues where voters side with Democrats, but, by and large, they trust Republicans to handle the economy.

Of course not, as you could readily infer from what I argued. What is plainly obvious is that the actually documentable harm from marijuana does not amount to a hill of beans compared to thousands of other things you could readily obtain from a supermarket shelf. As is extensively documented in the Nixon Report, the DEA report, and every subsequent important official report commissioned by agencies of our own government. If I were to choose a "rather stupid opinion to hold", it would be that there is any scientifically, or forensically sound basis for continuing to waffle about whether or not marijuana prohibition is a profoundly totalitarian, anti-constitutional, anti-intellectual pile of racist bs.

Well the US has a lot of political clout in the UN and throughout the world. When they threw their weight behind anti-drug treaties like the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, most countries signed on. The US has continued to exert their influence to make countries continue to comply with these agreements. As to why the US government wants marijuana to be universally illegal, that's a whole 'nother discussion.The Netherlands have developed their policy caught between two great forces: the will of the US as outlined in treaty agreements, and the desire not to continue an injustice against their own citizens. What they have is a rather imperfect system of decriminalization and turning a blind eye.

I don't think all drugs should be legal because of what you mentioned. If the drug can cause impairment to the point of harming someone else, then it should be illegal. Marijuana should be regulated exactly the same as cigarettes. I have yet to hear one solid argument against marijuana that wouldn't be hypocritical considering alcohol and tobacco are legal. People have told me they are different, and they shouldn't be compared. This is actually correct. Alcohol and tobacco are notably worse.

>Because I know a handful of people who are in jail for marijuana related crimes mainly because police couldn’t make more serious charges stick.So we should keep people in jail for having committed an act that is no longer a crime just in case they actually are guilty people but the judicial system couldn't prove it? That goes against the presumption of innocence.

But what are the sources covering it. CNN, HuffPo, etc. are obviously liberal news outlets and as such are going to cover a predominately liberal issue. Until you see Fox News do a Dr. Gupta-style pro-marijuana segment, you are still in the echo-chamber of legalization talk among more liberal news outlets. As I stated elsewhere America is very right leaning, even in people considered liberal. The median voter for the US falls well to the right of a middle 50 ADA score of "liberalness". If you want to use a news outlet as a meter of voter opinions, it will need to be Fox News (sadly).

Those prosecutions rest with the DOJ. Obama could simply fire any prosecutor who presses charges against the marijuana seller. I mean, he said he would stop the DEA raids when he was campaigning in 08.Only problem is he already broke that promise.Shit.

> The government now has a monopoly on access to the (legal) means of Cannabis production and distributionBy this reasoning, any regulated industry (i e, every single legal product in Canada) is a monopoly simply because the government regulates them. The government doesn't produce cannabis, they just regulate those who produce it. no different than beer, wine, tobacco, and a shitload of other consumer products.

> TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other drugs. In the event a substance that appears to be marijuana is observed during security screening, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer.That's directly from the [TSA website](http://apps.tsa.dhs.gov/mytsa/cib_results.aspx?search=medical%20marijuana).

I just looked at the 5 games matches of Pax. I assumed after Kemna's tweed that the games would always go to the first pick. So: wim, loss, win, loss, win. And that the first pick team won that way. But that was never the case, al the teams won some second pick games. I can understand first pick is a little stronger and maybe we start to need 2 bans before the start of the draft (3th ban). But it is not that big of an advantage that it will automatically win the games for you.

No I wouldn't. But the fact that something (alcohol) that can potentially make a person dangerous is already doesn't mean that other similar substances should be legal. That's not the argument. The argument is that marijuana, alcohol should be legal because it is the user's choice--and i fully support that.

What a shitty crooked ruling, but that tourist was a fool not to just table his hand and scoop the pot. Fine, the reg bent the rules and forced the tourist to show his winning hand. But you can still show you hand and scoop the pot.I bet if the reg was angle shooting and happened to turn a winning hand over, the table would have raised hell and cashed out anyway.

this isn't the awnser you were looking for but one time when I was tripping with my friends. We were talking about one of our buddies who got caught with an 8th of weed. so we were trying to say damn he got fucked by the big black dick of the law. but it came out as " he really got fucked by the bigbackdiggadawah" lol it was so funny. It took my like 5 minutes to say it correctly because we were all laughing so hard.

No, though rates will vary by cause and crime type. For example rates of maurajuana smoking are nearly equal between races, yet [ACLU shows that black people are 4 times more likely to be arrested](https://www.aclu.org/feature/war-marijuana-black-and-white).It is also incorrect to frame many crimes in the context of race, its much more predictive to do it by socioeconomic realities of different racial groups. Socioeconomic realities are a result of government policies or economic changes not inherent differences in races.

Funny you should reference real-world behind-the-wheel studies. I remember reading one where the researchers, after observing stoned people driving on a closed track, concluded it would be reasonably safe to do additional studies on public roads, as long as there was a co-driver. I'll try to find it. In the meantime, **"There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance"** - *University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales* **"THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs** - *(Robbe, 1994; Robbe and O'Hanlon, 1995; O'Hanlon et al., 1995)"* - *University of Limburg, Netherlands* **"There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected"** - *University of Adelaide, South Australia* **"marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident"** - *University of Toronto, Canada* **"In two studies with reasonable numbers of individuals who had only used cannabis, there was no clear evidence of increased culpability in these drivers."** - *The Lancet* **"No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis"** - *Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute* **"Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving"** - *Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs* **"The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08"** - *U.S. Department of Transportation Study* **"[Cannabis'] effect on higher cognitive functions, for example divided attention tasks associated with driving, appear not to be as critical. Drivers under the influence of cannabis seem aware that they are impaired, and attempt to compensate for this impairment by reducing the difficulty of the driving task, for example by driving more slowly."** - *"The Influence of Cannabis on Driving," Prepared for Road Safety Division, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, UK, by Transport Research Laboratory, Ltd.*

I think this was a delivery clarification memo. The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify what entities are authorized by the Department of Public Health (“Department”) to **deliver marijuana** for medical use to registered patients and caregivers in Massachusetts.Only state-approved Registered Marijuana Dispensaries (“RMD”) are authorized to sell or **deliver marijuana** for medical use in Massachusetts. Sounds pretty clear to me.

Found out my girlfriend of 2 + years had been cheating on me a few months ago. I broke up with her due to her drinking problem and lack of motivation along with a few red flags that I kind of ignored towards the end. I got arrested because I broke a flower pot in a fit of rage while she wasn't home. Made me realize that the person you are dating is a direct reflection of yourself, I've had a lot of alone time and time to think about everything that happened and looking back, I met her at a time in my life where I was partying and doing drugs all the time and we had a very fun relationship in the beginning. I haven't gone out nearly as much and have been focusing on my work life ever since the end of that.

I'd say most green is much more indica dominant than sativa, you can find some sativa hybrids, but in non legal states, it's mostly indica dominant, and virtually zero sativa only

Wait really? Hold up so no steak, steak and kidney, sausage rolls, cheese grillers, spare rib, mutton or chicken pies??Can anyone confirm if Canada has steak or spare rib pies because it looks like Colorado and Washington DC is off my list of places I'd like to live, I mean what's the point in having legal weed if you can't even gorge yourself on steak pies while baked?

##Papaver rhoeasPapaver rhoeas (common names include common poppy, corn poppy, corn rose, field poppy, Flanders poppy or red poppy) is an annual herbaceous species of flowering plant in the poppy family, Papaveraceae. This poppy is notable as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including "corn" and "field") and after World War I as a symbol of dead soldiers.Before the advent of herbicides, P. rhoeas sometimes was so abundant in agricultural fields that it could be mistaken for a crop. However, the only species of Papaveraceae grown as a field crop on a large scale is Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove

Since before even the first state voted to legalize recreational marijuana I'm sitting here thinking about how it's inevitable so why not be one of the first states?Eventually it'll get to a point where you're not only behind but become an outsider.When the future shows where things are going why not be the first ones on board and reap the benefits before everyone else does.

I've tried weed and it was pretty good.I'd like to try on LSD and Magic Shrooms if it ever gets legalized because I want to enter the psychedelic state most musicians and artists had in the past.

Prohibition created the mafia. Ending it severely undercut their funding to the point where they were no longer capable of fighting or buying the government outright. Ending the war on drugs would drastically reduce the violence being experienced in Mexico. How much of the pot money in Colorado and Washington do you think is going towards funding the cartels now? How is it that you can bring up prohibition and not even see that the main lesson learned from that escapade was that prohibition creates organized crime? The only reason we are still fighting the war on drugs is because all of the violence is happening somewhere else, so people don't care.

Is there an anime protagonist that can EVEN TOUCH Uzumaki Naruto's awesomeness? And I'm not talking about Uzumaki Naruto who was orphaned at the ripe age of 0 years old. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who had the Bijuu, Yang Kurama sealed within him. I'm not talking about Uzumaki Naruto who possessed 3 distinctive whisker-like marks on his cheeks and was never questioned about it. Hell, I'm not even talking about Uzumaki Naruto who disobeyed Umino Iruka-sensei in the Academy and acted like the class clown.No, I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who lived alone in his house and lived on pot ramen and expired milk that gave him explosive diarrhoea. I'm talking about Uzumaki Naruto who beat the shit out of Mizuki with his newly learnt Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu at before he even became a Genin.

Perhaps you could base your opinions of cannabis' effect on driving on *science*, as opposed to preconceptions: "There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance" - University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales "The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08" - U.S. Department of Transportation Study "No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis" - Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute "THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs - University of Limburg, Netherlands "There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected" - University of Adelaide, South Australia "marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident" - University of Toronto, Canada "Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving" - Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs

i like c/cdont really want to get in, and the value from raising seems reasonably negated by difficulty maneuvering when he doesn't fold.you could donk but again, it's harder to play out on the turn and river, and youve given your hand away sooner than need be. he's almost certainly c-betting that flop, so no reason to tip your hand before you at least get that bet.so i c/c, maybe c/c turn maybe donk turn, easy river donk if he knocks back turn. that line (c/c flop, turn checks through, you donk river) also works really well as a bluff on the river (presumably for missed draws, although i ahve gotten greedy and done it with complete air) because it looks like a one pair hand and if he has nothing, he has no reason to make a play for the pot since all he put in was his flop c-bet. you'll get a LOT of folds on the river if you bet after the turn checks through and you c/c the flop. (although this means of course, that you can also check the river with your AJ if he's even somewhat likely to take another stab, since with so many folds, the value of betting your legitimate hand is much less)

My understanding is that before legalization federally, the Vancouver police considered marijuana related "crimes" to be a waste of their time and resources (truth) to bust, so never enforced the law.That means shops could openly operate without fear of the local police shutting them down. I think there was a few RCMP raids on these shops before legalization though.

How does the left wing fight against individual rights or free speech? Particularly in an age when the left wants to legalize recreational marijuana and the right wants to increase penalties, that just doesn't hold water.

I'd like to go into a little more detail.An officer who pulls you over or walks up to your car needs Probable Cause to search your car. This can be obtained in many different ways like having illegal paraphernalia in plain sight (the officer can reach into your car and grab it allowing him to look for more), looking as though you are trying to hide something gives an officer probable cause, or doing something illegal in the first place gives an officer probable cause too. If you are arrested your vehicle can be searched without your consent because Probable Cause was proven and is no longer needed to search .If an officer asks you for consent to search your vehicle you do not have to give the officer consent to search your vehicle. If an officer has Probable Cause to search your vehicle than you would probably be detained in case something illegal is found in your vehicle. The only time warrants are really needed in the search of a car is if you are brought in on the suspicion of committing a crime and don't give consent to the search and seizure of your property, of course this happens in a manner different from traffic stops...Here's some advice for the people, if you have anything illegal in your car keep it out of sight, if you keep documents in your glove box guess where not to put all of your weed? Don't act suspicious and give the officer Probable Cause to search your car, keep your hands on the steering wheel, politely answer the officer's questions, if asked exit the vehicle, etc,etc.

Trump is easily the most moderate presidential candidate. He's the most friendly to abortion, planned parenthood, gay rights, legalizing marijuana, healthcare, and protectionist trade agreements.I think what you mean to say is, the media hate Republicans so much and does such a good job character assassinating them they won't win the independent/moderate vote. Although I disagree since I'm more or less an independent and I like Trump the most. Polls also show that he's winning among independent voters.

Raise more preflop. You've got a premium hand and are letting him call 75 cents into a $3 pot to see the flop. Make that raise to like $2.50.Bet flop. Or check-raise flop. There's legit straight draws out there.Check turn.As played, probably shove turn after he raises you. One of those opponents almost always has a straight (hopefully both do if one does) and you're right about at break-even odds for that. Once in a while you're up against a worse set and two pair, and you're way ahead.>This guy beat me last night chasing a straight on the turnNo. He wasn't chasing. He semi-bluffed the flop with his gutshot and hit it on the turn. All the money went in when you were behind. You have to punish his steal attempts and his semi-bluffs when you have a hand to do it with. He played this totally standard and you let him get there.

Now the difference between you and I are my parents are a lot like his. The first time I got popped for weed they said no contact with any of them. Now I knew that the kids I got caught with would be "down for the squad" if you will ao I told them what we what. To this day every time i say im going over to chill i get the look and hear "don't be smokin dope and driving!!!"In the end, you did all you could to help him while things went wrong and obviously showed remorse for his bad trip. I can tell you right now if I'd gotten a call like that I wouldn't have said shit. Probably would have hung up because when it comes down to felony drugs, I don't fuck around with people that can get me caught up. So if it means anything I see the effort and what YOU went through over someone who thought they could handle their drugs but couldn't. Best of luck to you and don't get hung up on it.

You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.P.S.:You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, opportunistic, barratrous, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, byzantine, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, libelous, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb,evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystopic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive,mind-numbing, arassive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, socially-retarded, puerile, clueless, and generally NOT GOOD.

The thing is, CPC needs to attract moderates to win a majority. Moderates seem to have voted for legal weed. Moderates will not vote CPC if legal weed is threatened. It’s also a further nail in the coffin for people thinking about switching to PPC. Soft libertarians will not vote for prohibition. They’ll switch to voting for the libertarianesque party that is the PPC. So if Scheer says the CPC will return us to prohibition he will alienate two different types of conservative voters (blue grits and soft libertarians) to pander to the the social conservatives who will vote CPC no matter what anyway. They won’t vote for anyone else even if Scheer says the CPC won’t bring back prohibition.

Not just an excuse, it helps pay for their toys. In many areas of the US, drug war forfeitures comprise a significant portion of the law enforcement budget. In other areas federal grant funding of local law enforcement is tied to cooperation with unpopular DEA enforcement (like helicopter searching of marijuana plants). This is one of the hurdles of ending the drug war, it literally pays for the police to keep fighting the drug war.

Heh, here in California even we have "weed deserts", where essentially you would have to drive for hours to get to a county with a legal weed shop, since they are allowing counties the power to not allow for shops within their borders. (e.g. essentially most inland counties). And of course inland counties are the cheaper areas to live. So its essentially, would you rather live in a cheap inland area. Or an area with a shop?

You just admitted that Mario Urioste wasn't a monster. I doubt he was the only non-violent offender there. When you keep murderers, thugs, rapists, and other violent criminals with non-violent offenders (shop lifters, weed-smokers, etc.) you expose them to violence that can cause them to turn to more violence once they are released from prison.

Has anyone seen any statistics about legalizing a drug over a period of years starting with the oldest of the population and ending with the minimum age of ~21? Ex. Legalize marijuana for people 55 and up the first year then four years later that age has lowered to the 30's and so on. Has that ever been used?

So he basically got a death penalty for weed! Only in USA! And the "life without parole" is a death penalty, just not one where the state executes you but you are sentenced to die in prison and will never be released. If you must die in prison, it is a death penalty.

My wife isn't a teacher, but she works in the education system and was sorting student incidents into folders the other day. Before our state legalized weed, a high school senior brought some to school and showed other kids. Then his english teacher saw it and he was like "I don't care if you smoke it just put it away when you're at school". The kid thought the teacher was cool with it so he put it away as told. Then the teacher secretly called the cops who came to arrest the kid. This was pretty much show and tell since the kid bragged about having it and told the other kids where he got it.

> He wasn't illegally carrying.? Yes he was. You need to read up more on the case. >He had a valid concealed carry permit. Why would you think he was carrying illegally?It is illegal to carry a weapon while under the influence of controlled substances. In this case, marijuana. Therefore, he was illegally carrying.

First he calls for the legalization of marijuana, and now this. My respect for this man is growing; he's the one prominent member of the Christian Right who is doing it right: Putting the mission, the philosophy, and the beliefs ahead of the politics!I hope he keeps this up, and I hope that a great many others take notice and follow his lead. Jesus didn't minister by going around judging everybody. Specifically, he judged those who brought harm to others, and the rest he forgave.This kind of religion is respectable. For the issues he's not doing this with yet, I hope he follows this from now on: If it will spawn hatred that will lead others to sin, then don't preach against a sin. For example, preaching against what they call the sin of homosexuality leads their congregations to sin via murder, brutal beatings, and denial of basic human rights. Remember that chapter of Saint Luke when Jesus said, "And ye shall deny human rights to all those whose practices ye disagree with?" Yeah, me neither. In fact, his entire philosophy is best summed up as, "If they're not hurting anybody, then what do you care? Love them. You sin too, after all." I'd like to see Christianity get back to that -- put Christ back in it, take the politics out!In fact, I'll make Christians a deal. Let that become the culture, and let that be found in the churches. Put Christ back in Christianity. Do this, and I'll go. I might not convert. I can't promise that. But I'll go, and I'll drop something in the collection plate. I don't feign ultimate knowledge. Let Christianity be Christianity again, and maybe your God can do the rest for some of us -- if He's there then it stands to reason that He could. If He doesn't or isn't there, then you'd be truer to Him and we'd be a better People together nonetheless.

>But I guess your civil rights don't matter to you. Civil rights? Give me a break. Smoking weed is no more a right than alcohol is. Alcohol is legal, but that doesn't mean its a right. Lots of things that are legal aren't rights, they're called privileges. Examples include all kinds of things, drinking, driving, cell phones, home ownership, pets. None of these are "rights." Voting is a right, freedom for peaceful assembly is a right. Freedom to practice religion, or not to as you see fit, is a right.

I was taught that slippery slope arguments are of the form X therefore Z or X entails ZWhat we usually call slippery slope arguments skip some step Y which would explain the jump from X to Z but the premise Y is non-existent. Look at an example:1. X: If you legalize marijuana then Z: you will have to legalize all drugs!In this example we are left to wonder why X entails Z there must be some reason (Y) which explains why X entails Z! if you ask someone, "why does Marijuana legalization entail all drug legalization?" they usually cannot come up with an answer. The Y premise which would explain why X entails Z is non-existent.

> I think the article fails to mention the paper, cotton and petrochemical industries losing out. > cotton is a substandard fiber to hemp in every way. Hemp is legal in many parts of the world yet we don't see hemp dominating other materials. Hemp fabric is uncomfortable and most "hemp clothes" are really hemp/cotton blends. And hemp ropes rot, so they're not replacing synthetic rope materials, ever.

"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities." -- Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman

It isn't just decriminalization that has 60%+ support. Pew has support for legalization at 61%. Another poll found 16% support keeping marijuana laws as they are, 29% support medical marijuana, 5% support decriminalization, 49% support recreational marijuana, and 1% weren't sure.

I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell? May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You remind me of drool. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go. You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have ignored most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you. P.S.: You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, opportunistic, barratrous, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, libelous, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb, evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystopic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive, mind-numbing, arassive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, abrasive, socially-retarded, puerile, clueless, and generally Not Good.

Well first let's agree on what the center is. Because if that's the most popular policies, it's [medicare for all](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/08/28/most-americans-now-support-medicare-for-all-and-free-college-tuition.html), [legal weed](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2018/10/22/18009142/marijuana-legalization-gallup-pew-polls-surveys), [free college](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/medicare-for-all-free-college-tuition-abolish-ice-polls-bernie-sanders-socialists), [they are divided among Syria, in whoch Pelosi supports the second least popular position](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/04/10/politics/syria-bombing-assad-poll/index.html) and I could go on. The point is, she doesn't support the progressive policies that Americans want. Here's what you do though. Why didn't she support Paula Jean Swearengin? A progressive in the primary? Maybe it's because you don't support what she believes in. Obviously I would campaign for all the democrats against Republicans in the general election if I was supreme leader of the democrats or whatever, but who she picks in the primary shows where the beliefs lie.

> Most Americans support decriminalization of drugs in general and full legalization for cannabis in particular.No. Most Americans do not support decriminalization of drugs in general. Seems they only really support marijuana with respect to decriminalization or legalization. Only a very slight majority (within the margin of error) support full legalization of cannabis.

This is from memory but I think he got into a physical altercation with a teacher, I'm pretty sure he either hit the teacher or threw a desk/chair at them. It may have been over weed but the altercation itself is what got him sent to juvie. Also she didn't so much make him stay there as refuse to hire an expensive attorney, and had him defended by a public defender. He also chose to plead guilty instead of taking any plea bargain. She basically said you got yourself into this mess, you make the decisions on how to handle it.

It's very different though, they smell completely different so one person might not care about weed smoke, but they hate cigarette smoke. Plus the effects are very different, weed gets you high while tobacco is more of a mood-changer. Also one is legal and one isn't (depending on where you are) so yeah, it wouldn't surprise me if someone was fine with one but not the other.

That's true - civil rights are universal but the phrase has a heavy connotation of racial equality. Considering he used "civil rights activist" as a term to distinguish itself from "legalized marijuana activist" I assumed he was using a narrow construction of "civil rights" that was possibly constrained to MLK-era activism.

The same applies to our justice system, for it is not infallible at all; innocent people can and have been proven guilty via our system, guilty people can and have been proven innocent via our system. Unfair punishments are handed out all the time via our system, whether [too harsh](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/02/opinion/vanita-gupta-marijuana-life-sentence/) or [too easy](http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/judge-excuses-wealthy-child-rapist/). Justice is justice, not matter how it is executed. i.g. **if** someone commits a heinous crime and is killed by a civilian or killed by our justice system the end result is them being [killed for their crime](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PUE8fYxjq8), which is justice.I think what you mean is our justice system is less likely to have false-positives/negatives than vigilante justice, and more likely to be fair. That may or may not be true, idk.

No offense, but if you've never cooked meat, I don't think I'd trust you to cook a steak, even with a video guide. A zero-effort meat dish that is still palatable is salsa chicken - put some boneless skinless chicken breasts in a crock pot, cover in a salsa your girlfriend likes. Put it on low and cook until the breasts hit 145-150. Turn off and remove from the heat. Serve with your choice of side.

If stronger tasting version of pie was invented, apart from its not quite pie, you're not legally supposed to eat it, and you don't know what nefarious things are in it, apart from it tastes way stronger than pie, not better, not even the same, just stronger. Now imagine if you could just run down and get a real pie instead. You'd do it wouldn't you? Strong cannabis is good, but rarely anyone smokes bud to get completely smacked up fucked

I agree with your point in general, but how many full prisons is 40,000 people, how much did it cost to build those prisons, and how much does it cost per yet to keep 40,000 people locked up? I estimate it's about ~4,000 prisoners per prison facility, so that's ten prisons, that [according to this link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://oig.justice.gov/reports/BOP/a0232/final.pdf&ved=0CCsQFjAFahUKEwi25O2MqdbIAhUUWGMKHc51DN8&usg=AFQjCNE4vo7e8HATIUBq-W2jAbQlhNPelA&sig2=hsPBVcKn9Es6VKdqHLu6ow) cost around $125 million apiece, so 10 prisons would cost $1.25 billion (taxpayer dollars obviously), and at an average cost of incarceration per prisoner per year of $30,000, we're looking at $1,200,000,000 (1.2 billion). Plus the fact that these prisons often ruin lives is a cost that is incalculable. So that's $1.25 billion to build and $1.2 billion to run every year for pot-related offenders.Note: the above are obviously approximations that apply to prisons. Jails are usually smaller than federal correctional facilities, but can cost as much as or more to run per year.

All I know is the penalty for a small amount of marijuana is a $200 fine, no jail time. Perhaps you still get arrested? Also, not sure if additional possession offenses might included jail time...most likely it's probably "violation of probation" related to other arrests.

ATTENTION ALL REDDITORS: If you are charged with misdemeanor pot possession in Cook County know that the prosecutors will NOT be able to prove their case in court. They never force the chemists to come to court on misdemeanor pot cases because they are too busy.So, as long as you plead NOT GUILTY and refuse to STIPULATE to the laboratory tests, the states attorneys will dismiss the case. They will attempt to get you to plead guilty for drug school or some BS but don't. JUST PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND RUN.

She tried to transport drugs to said society. A drug that a lot of people OD on, a drug that for the most part, ruins people's lives. She wasn't transporting weed.

I’m saying DARE isn’t great, but it’s not the reason why people try other drugs. I’m saying I don’t think any person has ever legitimately gotten seriously addicted to hard drugs because they tried pot and it wasn’t as bad as DARE said.At most, DARE is ineffective rather than harmful, so why is it so often blamed for people ruining their lives with drugs?

Unless you’re a lawyer or working a high managerial position, you’ll usually only get drug tested once before you start working. It’s company policy. Managers usually don’t care if you smoke pot or use some drugs recreationally in your free time. Its HR who signs the waivers for you to get drug tested. And even then, it’s due to company policy. In the 3 positions that required a drug test, none of my managers micro managed me.

A circlejerk I can agree with (Though not to the extent that reddit takes it) is the "children are fucking annoying" circlejerk. And to some extent... the eugenics circlejerk. Not reddit's version of eugenics which is basically "sterilize stupid people", but "abort fetuses with severe/unfixable birth defects".I absolutely fucking hate the racism, sexism, and other bigotry on reddit. In addition, I hate the piracy circlejerk, the Valve circlejerk, the "class" circlejerk, the NSA circlejerk, the "pedophiles are good people and Cp should be legalized!" circlejerk, the weed circlejerk, and... well, pretty much 99.9% of all circlejerks on this website.

I did this as a teenager once too. They can't come in the house. We shut off all the lights and didn't answer the door. Some friends bailed, one friend even jumped off the deck ran through the woods and then called someone else for a ride... without shoes. Two other friends who bailed at first ran into the woods, one hid under the wood shed. The cops walked all around the house then back to the front. he texted us and we let him back in the back door when the cops were out front. Another friend did the same and claimed he threw a rock in the other direction and ran when the cops turned their back, or so he says. Everyone just hid, they shined lights in the windows and we all just kept quiet and hid. At one point a cop walked into the open garage, and started knocking on the door from the garage to the house. I remember being like a foot from the door terrified, but just left the door locked and never answered. The only thing that happened was everyone parked on the street got a parking ticket for parking between 3am and 6am on the street because apparently that is a law even though people leave cars on that street 24/7. Much better than getting busted for being underage and drinking and oh yeah my friends who bailed also had at least an oz or two of weed on them.

Marijuana does not fund the Mexican Drug War - Marijuana Prohibition does.If they would legalize it - no one would have to shoot anyone to get it - or control its sale. The only reason they fight over it, is because by making it illegal we make it insanely profitable. Legalize it - and the profit goes away.Amazing to me how quickly people forget alcohol prohibition, and [The St. Valentine's day Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Valentine%27s_Day_massacre). As soon as they repealed prohibition, the wars over control of the distribution of alcohol stopped. Prohibition, led to massive corruption, and organized crime, and continued marijuana prohibition is doing the same thing today.

>I'd personally be a bit leery of anyone who thought that it was unmanly to know how to cook more than pot noodles or baked beans...I do agree with you here. I am more retro than metro, and I grill outdoors, weather permitting, for the entire family once a weekend-- steaks, burgers, chicken, shrimp, ribs, potatoes, manly stuff like that. I also will sometimes cook something exotic or foreign inside, like Chinese or Indian, or hand-made pizza.

See I could almost agree with you but no one really goes from caffeine to weed in a conscius "Time to get more fucked up" kinda way.If your mindset is to enjoy weed to get fucked up rather than to enjoy weed for weed it may be a gateway for you, but I think there's most people who smoke weed and have no interest in other drugs ever than those who smoke weed and then start going harder and harder.Honestly I feel like cigarettes are a gateway drug if anything. Think about it, one cigarette probably won't kill you, the little headrush is nice and the high for weed is similar but on a larger, different scale. A teenager might smoke cigarettes (something legal) before they smoke weed (Not legal and not generally something parents leave in the open like they might with socially acceptable cigarettes).I started with weed, smoked cigarettes when I had no weed, and that's all I've tried or had much interest in trying.

You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As we say in Texas. I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselfs in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you ckoke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll.Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.the only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of your of whay you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

They changed the rules for the dispensary. I just read it in the dispensary section of the OMMP website. I had it explained in simple terms to me today on the phone by OMMP also. If you're dispensary is letting folks into their facility without an actual current card it is now illegal. EDIT: This is from the new dispensary section of OMMP. Q. Who can purchase or receive medical marijuana from a dispensary?A. Medical marijuana can only be dispensed to patients and caregivers who present a current and valid Oregon Medical Marijuana Program card and photo identification. No other sales or transfers are authorized. Also this:For PatientsQ. What will I need in order to be dispensed medical marijuana from a dispensary?A. You will need to present your current and valid Oregon Medical Marijuana Program card and photo identification.

> schedule 1 narcoticCannabis is schedule 1? Were they high when they made that list?According to Wikipedia, a schedule 1 drug requires the following>The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.> The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.> There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.Which, tbh, sounds like triple bullshit, even if you disagree with the legalization of cannabis.

As a big fan of drugs I just want to say to the youngsters out there that Salvia really isn't cool. If you need a legal high try that fake weed crap, yeah it tastes like shit and it's probably bad for you, but Salvia tastes worse and it operates in a whole different way than other hallucinogens I've tried, seems like it's just causing your brain to short-circuit.

Why is big tobacco afraid of legalized cannabis? If cannabis were legalized, big tobacco is uniquely situated to rise to the top of the new industry and dominate it. They already have the infrastructure in place and they already grow, process, and market a very similar product.

No, because hemp paper is harder to produce and shitty in comparison to wood sourced paper. Hemp cultivation for fiber and paper is perfectly legal in many countries. It's just not economical because it's more expensive to process and creates an inferior product.

Well I guess this is *very* anecdotal, but it's way easier for me to get weed than it is to get alcohol, which is legal. Because there are weed dealers all over the place that don't really care how old you are, but everywhere that sells alcohol checks IDs. It's not a huge difference in access but it's definitely there.

Psychedelics are really about all I'm interested in. I recently discovered booze after a long tenure in prudishness, and it's just fantastic. I think weed and shrooms look like a hell of a lot of fun, but I kinda want to pace myself so I don't do anything stupid and I also really don't want to get arrested.

US Constitution, Article 6, paragraph 2: >This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. Constitutionally speaking, all Federal laws trump any state law on the matter. State laws may however be more restrictive, or compulsive, whatever the nature of the statute. The tenth amendment 'merely' states that were Federal law does not speak, the matter falls to the states, and failing that, the right is reserved to the people. Since in this case Federal law has a statute prohibiting marijuana, the text of the tenth amendment isn't relevant. A constitutional challenge to marijuana prohibition would have to be based on a different facet of the constitution, and be focused on a supposed lack of authority of the federal government to pass legislation on the matter. I believe that the supreme court has ruled that it does have such authority though, or precedent to that effect, so a constitutional challenge may be for naught. May be better to focus on removing the law.

You should read the 10th Amendment.Edit: Here you go:"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."So because the Constitution does not give the federal government the explicit right to regulate marijuana it cannot regulate marijuana within the borders of a state unless the state allows it. Therefore in this matter a state's laws do supersede federal law within the borders of the state.

The gold bud and the red bud I was getting in the mid 1970s was *amazing*. I'm sure the cultivated strains are just as good today, but I live in a state where I can't get that. And I'm old, with no good connections, so I've only been able to get sleepy dirtweed. So from my perspective the potency has gone down. I wish I lived in a state where I could buy good weed legally.

Ok so THC stimulates the CB-1R or cannabinoid type one receptor. There is an endogenous cannabinoid, or cannabinoid produced inside of your body, called anandamide that also stimulates this receptor. In fact there are few endogenous cannabinoids that stimulate this receptor but we'll stick with just anandamide for now. The CB-1R and anandamide are part of your endogenous cannabinoid system. The endogenous cannabinoid system is responsible for, among other things, appetite regulation. Stimulation of the CB-1 receptors surpasses nausea. Interestingly, frequent users of cannabis who stop using suddenly can sometimes exhibit a phenomenon known as cannabis hyperemesis syndrome where they experience cyclic vomiting which is a kind of equal and opposite reaction.

Are there any real benefits to cannabinoids or marijuana in general?Are there any significant long term effects of marijuana use? These are studies that would be much easier to conduct if weed was legal, but should still be thoroughly investigated before the public has easy access to the drug.

Opiates suppress cortisol (stress hormone) so our adrenal glands work harder to produce more cortisol while using to counter act the suppression. When we quit the cortisol isn't suppressed anymore but the adrenal glands take time to adjust out of overdrive so for a few months after quitting opiates your pumping out a lot of stress hormone and it takes time to balance out, so this is why you're feeling so stressed. Theres a great herb for this called Ashwagandha, it's an adaptogen which helps regulate cortisol and it's been scientifically proven to lower our stress hormones, it also helps you sleep better. I take ashwagandha every night and it's made a huge difference in my day-to-day life, I'd try some and see if it helps !

Done salvia a few times. It's not like shrooms or weed. It's like a bunch of acid in 4 minutes. It's a genuine happy laugh, unfortunately The majority if stories I hear about salvia are bad trips, but I've had nothing but awesome (hysterical laughter like this guy) trips. Salvia is effin legal, which makes zero sense to me.

Pot was made illegal in the 1930s for similar reasons. Here's a quote from [Harry J. Anslinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_J._Anslinger):> There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.

In the current legal climate where most people have to grow indoor if they want to grow, growing high quality marijuana is way more difficult than brewing beer. Especially considering the start up costs and time/expertise required to build a working room. It takes a ton of work to grow large amounts of marijuana indoors.

Great question.Federal law overruling of state law occurs under what is called the Supremacy Doctrine, which itself arises out of the [Supremacy Clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause).The relevant part states:*"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; ... shall be the supreme law of the land."*In other words, constitutional laws passed by Congress are considered Supreme and trump state laws. The Tenth Amendment retains power for the states that is not otherwise granted to Congress. Congress' laws are presumed valid unless proven otherwise, so that's where this situation comes from.If marijuana regulation would be declared an unconstitutional exercise of federal power, then state laws would become supreme until another federal law came into being (if it ever did). Until then, federal law trumps.

No he doesn't. Plus, do you really think that with all the support of legal weed that it's going to do anything other than become more and more accepted? Legal weed ain't going to be shut down, that cats' already out of the bag. If the citizens want it to remain legal it will remain legal.

Federal law is created by the federal government. It comes in the form of statutes (laws created by Congress) or federal court decisions (“precedent”). However, each state also has a state court system and legislative body which can create its own laws in the same way. So, for example, when a Massachusetts legislature passes a law, it is a state law in Massachusetts. When the US Congress passes a law, it is a federal law which applies to all 50 states (generally speaking). When there is a conflict between a state law and a federal law, federal law generally supersedes (called “pre-emption”). However, there are situations where that is not always the case. To further understand this, do some reading on marijuana laws. There is a lot of conflict between federal law and state law right now which exemplifies the two different systems.

It's not about what you're attracted to, it's about what's biologically ready.Laws can exist, sure, but there's a difference between an 18 year old and a 15 year old who are both bioligically mature having sex, and a creepy old man having sex with a prepubscent minor. Just like there's a difference between a 15 year old smoking pot, and a 10 year old, even though both are illegal.

25 year old me gets 15 year old me to smoke pot, and 5 year old me tells mom...mom has 25 year old me arrested for contributing to the delinquency of the minor. 15 year old and 5 year old me become at risk of losing the apartment because they can't get jobs. So,15 year old me becomes pot dealer and uses 5 year old me as a drug mule. 15 year old me and 5 year old me get arrested, tried, and convicted. 15 year old and 5 year old me roomates again with 25 year old me in Folsom.The end.

I wasn't trolling, it's a legitimate question. I had a bad (and profound) experience with an edible, I thought I was going to die because my heart rate felt like it was beating way too fast. You can't compare a cannabis induced panic attack, to more controllable panic attacks like fear of public speaking. My question wasn't if cannabis kills you, it was if you could get a heart attack from a panic attack (which does happen if you get too high).Thanks for responding, even though you were a pompous asshole about it.

"The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08" - *U.S. Department of Transportation Study* "There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance" - *University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales* "THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs - *University of Limburg, Netherlands* "There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected" - *University of Adelaide, South Australia* "Marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident" - *University of Toronto, Canada* "In two studies with reasonable numbers of individuals who had only used cannabis, there was no clear evidence of increased culpability in these drivers." - *The Lancet* "No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis" - *Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute* "Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving" - *Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs*

Advice from a mid-gold who also likes to play Ori.Start shield level 1, shield yourself when she uses her Sigil of Silence and auto her mercilessly with your passive if she comes in for trade. If you shield properly, you will be much stronger in level 1 trades. Leblanc is super squishy and your autos wreck her throughout the game; unlike your abilities, they can't miss, so remember to auto her when you fight!You don't need to be aggressive in this match up, as Ori massively outscales Leblanc for teamfights. Focus on farming and on returning damage when Leblanc tries to trade with you. I recommend barrier: you should be focusing on staying safe and outscaling her, not on getting kills with ignite.Unless leblanc is super fed, she will struggle to do damage to you if she can't land her chain or her dash (if she doesn't land those and you shield her q, she will do about 0 damage).So:1. Stay outside her zone (her dash range) and use your ball to zone her with your W damage. When you reposition the ball with q, start moving away asap, this is when you are at your weakest. On the other hand, ifleblanc ever wastes her dash, she is extremely vulnerable.2. While staying away from her, be ready to sidestep her chain if she uses dash - sigil - chain. Standing behind minions makes it extra hard for leblanc to hit the chain.3. Chalice + health pot spam makes this lane much easier4. Go heal if you are low and one landed chain can end your life. Leblanc is a great tower diver, but she is slow at taking towers. She might roam, instead, so warn your team if you think she might!Other notes:- Don't ult randomly. She will easily dodge it with her dash or Mimic'd dash. Don't waste it unless she is oom, all dashes are on cd or she is cc'd- Ward to make sure you don't get ganked and even tower-dived by leblanc + jungler if you are not full hp- If you farm safely, Leblanc's best answer is to roam. You need to ward to see where she goes, warn your team when she is missing, and punish her by pushing into her tower (but don't get ganked when you do the latter!)In my experience, this is an ori-favoured match up. Unless ori messes up and leblanc snowballs, ori will outscale her massively. Without the snowball and her silence, leblanc will just become free gold for your carries when she jumps into them late game.

You are an asshole, a cad, a weasel, a pissworm. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficientin all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyondthe laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”. Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.P.S.:You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, opportunistic, barratrous, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, byzantine, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, libelous, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb,evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystopic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive,mind-numbing, arassive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, socially-retarded, puerile, clueless, and generally NOT GOOD.

Indica is specifically a part of the cannabis sativa genus. Better explanation from the wiki:"Cannabis indica, formally known as Cannabis sativa forma indica, is an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family."So "cannabis sativa" in the language of the law covers sativa, indica, and hybrids.

A dude in high school who started hanging around a few of my friends. I said I didn't like him but didn't have a real reason why. Over the next few years he got my friends into weed, cocaine, alcohol, and starting fucking the girl I was interested in at the time. She had to get her parents to bail him out of jail twice because he was stealing and got caught with drugs.Found out later that another of my friends had had to have her dad chase the dude away with a shotgun because he wouldn't stop harassing her. Man that guy was a shitlord.

Substantial whole blood THC concentrations persist multiple days after drug discontinuation in heavy chronic cannabis users. It is currently unknown whether neurocognitive impairment occurs with low blood THC concentrations, and whether return to normal performance, as previously documented following extended cannabis abstinence, is accompanied by removal of residual THC in brain. These findings also may impact the implementation of per se limits in driving under the influence of drugs legislation.

Well, in regards to the question of whether LA should create a city owned bank, there are several issues. First of all, private banks have different priorities than a public one would have, and may not show interest in giving out loans to certain industries or regions. Also, FDIC banks are currently prohibited from doing any kind of banking with legal marijuana businesses so it would open up that sector to banking which would benefit the industries. And public banks are also able to take on greater levels of risk, or give out longer term and lower interest loans than what you would see in the private sector, so it can be friendlier to consumers in many ways. They are not saying that we get rid of all private banks, just that having a public bank create additional benefits that we wouldn't see if we only relied on the private sector.

Same with me. I get anxiety, feel very uncomfortable, get paranoia. I've had episodes with weed where it gave me a full blown panic attack (feel my heart beating fast & loud, think I'm going into cardiac arrest, completely freeze up) as well as full blown auditory hallucinations. Although one thing I noticed is if I' am really drunk I don't get any negative effects.

It was not marijuana, yes she is in custody.I'm not sure how the court system works but I assume she at least has to go before a judge to have a public defender assigned and then an arraignment hearing set?I don't see them releasing her on OR as she doesn't live in that state and has little to no money to return for future court hearings.

["The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/index.html)

**Papaver rhoeas**Papaver rhoeas (common names include common poppy, corn poppy, corn rose, field poppy, Flanders poppy or red poppy) is an annual herbaceous species of flowering plant in the poppy family, Papaveraceae. This poppy is notable as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including "corn" and "field") and after World War I as a symbol of dead soldiers.Before the advent of herbicides, P. rhoeas sometimes was abundant in agricultural fields. Although the corn poppy (and its cultivars such as the Shirley poppy) and the California poppy are widely grown in gardens, only Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, has significant farm production.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/whatsthisplant/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Every 2 weeks or so, I make homemade soup in a gigantic pot. It takes hours to cook but not really a lot of work to make. The beauty part is that I fill the freezer with containers of delicious soup that make Campbell's and Progresso taste like prison food and just pop one in the refrigerator a day or two before I'll need it.Just heat and eat. Add bread and butter and you're in heaven.I use a bag of dried beans and a couple of chickens or a big hunk of beef, along with carrots, celery, onions, garlic, peas, spices, cans of broth and a little hot sauce for flavor.

>all McDonalds did was serve coffee the same way as everyone else.No, [they didn't](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm). *McDonalds also said during discovery that, based on a consultants advice, it held its coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees fahrenheit to maintain optimum taste. He admitted that he had not evaluated the safety ramifications at this temperature. Other establishments sell coffee at substantially lower temperatures, and coffee served at home is generally 135 to 140 degrees.* *Further, McDonalds' quality assurance manager testified that the company actively enforces a requirement that coffee be held in the pot at 185 degrees, plus or minus five degrees. He also testified that a burn hazard exists with any food substance served at 140 degrees or above, and that McDonalds coffee, at the temperature at which it was poured into styrofoam cups, was not fit for consumption because it would burn the mouth and throat. The quality assurance manager admitted that burns would occur, but testified that McDonalds had no intention of reducing the "holding temperature" of its coffee.**Plaintiffs' expert, a scholar in thermodynamics applied to human skin burns, testified that liquids, at 180 degrees, will cause a full thickness burn to human skin in two to seven seconds. Other testimony showed that as the temperature decreases toward 155 degrees, the extent of the burn relative to that temperature decreases exponentially. Thus, if Liebeck's spill had involved coffee at 155 degrees, the liquid would have cooled and given her time to avoid a serious burn.*

I work construction you fail a test for just weed and most companies will fire you on the spot. Some use at home tests (like them but expensive ones they can legally use) and make you piss in their bathroom. Had a safety guy come to a job site and say everyone is peeing in a cup in the portopotty, refuse to and you are fired then, fail the test and you will be fired within 20 mins of the test. We lost half our crew that day and 90% was for smoking weed at night.

Because violence is wrong and if it means harsher punishment for violence related behavior then I’m all for it. If you commit a crime under the influence (unlikely) or have possession of it, it may enable the DA to prosecute easier. If you didn’t commit a violent crime or a crime that is petty who cares if you have weed or are under the influence. Discretion is important.

Honestly: I haven't read the evidence, but I am an environmental scientist. I read a paper in undergrad about Monsanto basically claiming a particular genome of weed-resistant corn. The corn Monsanto patented was bred to keep weeds away, I believe it's called Round-Up Ready. Sounds great at first, Monsanto creates an amazing corn that doesn't need a pesticide because the pesticide is WITHIN the plant's DNA. Well, the Monsanto corn pollinated other corn plants, and then Monsanto sued the local farmers whose crops, by way of the wind, cross-pollinated with the Monsanto Round-Up Ready corn. Monsanto tested the DNA of the local farmers corn to prove they stole the 'intellectual property' and sued the farmers. Fuck Monsanto.Edit: not corn, canola.

More on the hectic life of Fela Kuti, founder of afrobeat, [available at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti).A brief excerpt of the middle years:> Fela and his band, Africa '70, returned to Nigeria. He then formed the Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio, and a home for many connected to the band that he later declared independent from the Nigerian state. Fela set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, named the Afro-Spot and then the Afrika Shrine, where he performed regularly. Fela also changed his middle name to Anikulapo (meaning "he who carries death in his pouch"), stating that his original middle name of Ransome was a slave name. The recordings continued, and the music became more politically motivated. Fela's music became very popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in general. In fact, he made the decision to sing in Pidgin English so that his music could be enjoyed by individuals all over Africa, where the local languages spoken are very diverse and numerous. As popular as Fela's music had become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was also very unpopular with the ruling government, and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. In 1974 the police arrived with a search warrant and a cannabis joint, which they had intended to plant on Fela. He became wise to this and swallowed the joint. In response, the police took him into custody and waited to examine his feces. Fela enlisted the help of his prison mates and gave the police someone else's feces, and Fela was freed. He then recounted this tale in his release Expensive Shit.> In 1977 Fela and the Afrika ’70 released the hit album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military. The album was a smash hit with the people and infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta Republic, during which one thousand soldiers attacked the commune. Fela was severely beaten, and his elderly mother was thrown from a window, causing fatal injuries. The Kalakuta Republic was burned, and Fela's studio, instruments, and master tapes were destroyed. Fela claimed that he would have been killed if it were not for the intervention of a commanding officer as he was being beaten. Fela's response to the attack was to deliver his mother's coffin to the main army barrack in Lagos and write two songs, "Coffin for Head of State" and "Unknown Soldier," referencing the official inquiry that claimed the commune had been destroyed by an unknown soldier.> Fela and his band then took residence in Crossroads Hotel as the Shrine had been destroyed along with his commune. In 1978 Fela married 27 women, many of whom were his dancers, composers, and singers to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic. Later, he was to adopt a rotation system of keeping only twelve simultaneous wives. The year was also marked by two notorious concerts, the first in Accra in which riots broke out during the song "Zombie," which led to Fela being banned from entering Ghana. The second was at the Berlin Jazz Festival after which most of Fela's musicians deserted him, due to rumors that Fela was planning to use the entirety of the proceeds to fund his presidential campaign.

Long story short, I slowly started getting my shit together after all of that.

I had just gotten off work and was about to leave for a hookah bar to chill with my buddies. I had rolled 2 fatass schwag joints waiting in my car. I lit one up, turned on the car, turned off the AC, rolled the windows up and got on the highway. After finishing it off and then unsurprisingly missing my turn, I got off the highway, started to so a Uie but then just turned left and went down that road for a bit jamming to my music. After a couple songs I decide to turn around so I pull into the next parking lot to get back on the highway. I don't know if you've ever been to a courthouse/DPS at 10pm but apparently, a fuckload of cops are there and even more empty cars. So with a smoke filled car and another joint in my cup holder I slowly rolled through and got to the exit and made damn sure to blinker and wait 3 seconds at the stop sign. Probably the closest call I've ever had in terms of harshest punishment.

I've been smoking pot pretty much daily since 1984 and I have no complaints. I used to smoke cigarettes, but quit in 1999.I guess I should add that I jog daily.I just checked out the government anti-cannabis website http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/marijuana.html and if they had any hard science to prove it's bad for your lungs they'd have it there.>Effects on the Lungs>Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increases the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;8 **however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.9 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.**>Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, a heightened risk of lung infections, and a greater tendency toward obstructed airways. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.10 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.Notice they don't have any citations when they say cannabis smoking can cause respiratory problems or when they say cannabis users' increased absenteeism is because of respiratory illness? I call bullshit.

Right. These are the biggest differences in the issues chart there: * Stricter limits on political campaign funds - Berwick strongly favors, Coakley opposes* Stricter punishment reduces crime - Berwick strongly opposes, Coakley favors, Grossman favors* Never legalize marijuana - Berwick opposes, Coakley strongly favors, Grossman strongly opposes According to this debate summary, though, Coakley and Grossman seemed to line up on marijuana legalization.

I agree. He said:>“In terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state. … Marijuana is such a big thing. I think medical should happen — right? Don’t we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states.”Personally, I don't care about weed. I just think states should make a decision about weed. Maybe, a prop to let people decide.

Here's a long but accessible Alito quote from the opinion:> The anticommandeering doctrine may sound arcane, butit is simply the expression of a fundamental structuraldecision incorporated into the Constitution, i.e., the decisionto withhold from Congress the power to issue ordersdirectly to the States. When the original States declaredtheir independence, they claimed the powers inherent insovereignty—in the words of the Declaration of Independence,the authority “to do all . . . Acts and Things whichIndependent States may of right do.” ¶32. The Constitutionlimited but did not abolish the sovereign powers of theStates, which retained “a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.” Thus, both the Federal Government and the Stateswield sovereign powers, and that is why our system ofgovernment is said to be one of “dual sovereignty.” > The Constitution limits state sovereignty in severalways. It directly prohibits the States from exercising someattributes of sovereignty. See, e.g., Art. I, §10. Somegrants of power to the Federal Government have been heldto impose implicit restrictions on the States. And the Constitution indirectly restricts theStates by granting certain legislative powers to Congress,see Art. I, §8, while providing in the Supremacy Clausethat federal law is the “supreme Law of the Land . . . anyThing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to theContrary notwithstanding,” Art. VI, cl. 2. This means thatwhen federal and state law conflict, federal law prevailsand state law is preempted.>The legislative powers granted to Congress are sizable,but they are not unlimited. The Constitution confers onCongress not plenary legislative power but only certainenumerated powers. Therefore, all other legislative poweris reserved for the States, as the Tenth Amendment confirms.And conspicuously absent from the list of powersgiven to Congress is the power to issue direct orders to thegovernments of the States. The anticommandeering doctrinesimply represents the recognition of this limit oncongressional authority.You have two key pull quotes here. First, "when federal & state law conflict, federal law prevails", and second "conspicuously absent from the list of powersgiven to Congress is the power to issue direct orders to thegovernments of the States". That is, Congress has a lot of power, and in general more power than the states. But Congress can't tell the states what to do.Think about this case: Congress could have made a law that said "all forms of gambling are illegal", much as they've made laws that say "the purchase or use of marijuana is illegal." But they didn't. They made a law that said "no state shall pass a law allowing for gambling." By phrasing it that way, they are telling states what laws to pass. That's unconstitutional. That's commandeering.

NJ doesn't cooperate with any other states gun laws and permits and as such other states don't cooperate with theirs. If a person in NJ wants to buy a gun, the NJ resident is responsible for making sure they follow the laws, the store selling you the gun doesn't have to follow NJ laws if they aren't located in NJ. It's like if I buy weed in Denver and drive back to NJ with it, the shop in Denver doesn't have to comply with NJ laws.

It is up to the judge to eliminate that kind of intimidation. If he fails to do that who knows what else he is doing to throw the trial -- probably everybody but the jury. If I was on a jury, and I saw a courtroom full of uniforms, my first thoughts would be this guy is guilty as sin if this is what he needs to do to get a not guilty verdict.The judge gets to decide what evidence the jury will hear, and what it will not hear. The judge even gets to decide what kind of a defense the defendant is allowed to bring up. In some cases, judges have been known to deny the defendant any real defense. The defense tactic in such cases is usually not say anything, and let the jury figure out that something is hinky. This happens a lot with medical pot cases, but is certainly not limited to them.

I'm sorry but you're wrong. Probable cause is the standard needed for a search or arrest in any circumstance. Vehicle, house, or person on the street. It's also the standard for an officer to obtain a warrant from the courts, which they would need if something were to occur that was not in their presence. It's all governed by the 4th Amendment. Something that occurs in the presence of an officer or that is in "plain view" (or plain smell/sound) of an officer does not require a warrant. And depending on what the probable cause is (and the reason for the search), an officer can go into a locked compartment in a vehicle or home without a warrant. If an officer has probable cause to believe that a TV is stolen, he can't go into a locked or even unlocked glove compartment. But if there is a strong smell of marijuana coming from the compartment he can. Do not believe Jay-Z lyrics. Now, consent is completely different than probable cause. If an officer has probable cause to search, consent is not required. But at the same time, no probable cause is required for a consent search. An officer can walk up to anyone he wants and ask to search them without any sort of reasonable suspicion or probable cause. However, the person doesn't have to consent to the search if there is no reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Also, during a consent search someone may restrict the search to anything he or she wants. For example: "Search my entire car except the glove compartment".

I believe you're actually the one getting the vocab wrong. Approval of Epidiolex will require rescheduling of cannabis. Cannabis is currently a Schedule 1 drug, which the DEA defines as follows (my ***emphasis***):> [Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with ***no currently accepted medical use*** and a high potential for abuse.](https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml)If the FDA approves Epidiolex, cannabis will have an accepted medical use, which will require the DEA to reschedule it. Tylenol with codeine is actually a decent, though not perfect, example. It's a Schedule III drug, with widespread legal use in the general public.

I can't really make it any more clear. Burning shit forms carcinogens. Burning steak forms carcinogens. Burning tobacco forms carcinogens. Burning marijuana forms carcinogens. So when he says that marijuana doesn't cause damage to you body like the other things that were mentioned I call bullshit. The only way that it wouldn't damage your body is if you ate edibles and most marijuana, whether legally or illegally, is smoked.

I think that the best reasons for supporting the legalization of marijuana also support the decriminalization of all drugs. I also think that the average Canadian doesn’t really care about those reasons, which is why there is political support for marijuana legalization (instead of marijuana decriminalization) but that the support probably doesn’t exist for drug decriminalization.

Yes and no. Maine offers limited reciprocity to medical marijuana patients from other states. Patients from other states are allowed to possess medical marijuana, and are protected from arrest for possessing medical marijuana (with their ID card from their home state) but they are not allowed to purchase medical marijuana from a dispensary.Theoretically, patients from other states are also allowed to grow medical marijuana in Maine, however the law also states that visitors staying in Maine for more than 30 days are required to register for the Maine medical marijuana program. But how much can you grow in a month?

The series has never had match making before. I'm pretty sure Valve/HPE was going for a focus on more competitive style play, thus the 5v5 match making. Look at games like DOTA2 or LoL, players strive to win and get better in the competitive 5v5 setting.These games also have penalties for leaving, such as ban times (LoL) or low-priority queue (DOTA2). If your a fan of the drop in drop out style, go play casual or gungame or find a community server. The competitive setting is geared towards players who want a competitive 5v5 match. A match with bots and 15 different opponents is NOT competitive.

So what is Schedule II: 21 U.S. Code § 812 - Schedules of controlled substances.Schedule II.—>(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.>(B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.>(C) Abuse of the drug or other substances may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.There are 5 schedules of controlled substances. Schedule II is the second most serious with the second most serious penalties.Examples of Schedule I substances are heroin and LSD. Currently, marijuana is a Schedule I substance. Examples of Schedule II substances are Oxycodone, Fentanyl, Morphine, Opium and Pentobarbital. So that you understand, Hillary is proposing that Marijuana be placed in the same class of controlled substances as oxys and opium. She is proposing that Marijuana is potentially as dangerous as these other Schedule II substances.

And there is no evidence they are lying about this. They do sue farmers who use seed with their gene and then utilize the value of the seed by spraying the crop with glyphosate.If you treat your crop as non-Roundup Ready and use normal weed control techniques, then you don't have to worry about Monsanto, whether your crop contains their gene or not. Your only concern would be if windblown contamination reduces the value of your crop because it was supposed to be organic.

> Sales of various pharmaceuticals (and profits of big companies) would see a significant drop.Don't forget the huge hit (*cough*) to tobacco profits. My theory is that the tobacco lobby is the biggest reason for marijuana's prolonged ban in the US.

The officer has the right to stop and search for the suspects for weapons. That is called a Terry search. They also have the right to search anywhere with in an arrestee's lunging area for a search incident to arrest. What she was trying to do was look through the doorway at any crime that is happening in plain view of her. Since the office had a right to be on the front porch, anything she see's is in plain view and would have given her probable cause to enter the home without a warrant due to "exigent circumstances" because the people inside might be destroying evidence. Once she was able to enter the home due to "exigent circumstances" she would have been able to view anything in plain sight or smell. Then if she smells pot, she can search that area. Once placing someone under arrest for the pot, she can search any area with in lunging distance for weapons but she will most likely find contraband which would then be in plain view. Homeboy in red probably saved all of his friends from getting arrested if they had any contraband out or you could smell any drugs.

You're right, but as I was saying that's a very large purchase for most people. When you go to the liquor store, you don't usually buy $150 worth, you buy one bottle at $30, or a 6 pack for $10. That's the way I expect most people will buy legal cannabis, which excludes MoMs. And if you do need to buy large quantities, it would be much cheaper to start growing your own

Kids will be encouraged to rat out their parents. Just think of how many kids turn their parents in under our marijuana laws. Just think of how many families, those kids’ own families!, were broken up under those shitty laws.

Can people please stop calling this stuff "synthetic marijuana"? It does not contain synthetic versions of any active chemical found in cannabis. It contains chemicals that may be synthetic, but are only designed to act in similar ways as the chemicals in cannabis. If it were truly "synthetic marijuana" it would be just as illegal as the chemicals found naturally in the cannabis plant.

There is zero benefit to consenting to a search. If a cop is going to give you a bogus ticket, they're going to give you a bogus ticket anyway. Someone else may have left something illegal in the vehicle, you may have stepped in something or had a cannabis leaf stick to your shoe and fall off in the car. You might get the one-in-a-million "I'm going to plant evidence" cop. If you consented to the search, you're screwed. If you did not consent, any halfway decent lawyer can use that to get you out of anything stemming from the search. If they threaten you, so what? "I do not consent to my person or vehicle being searched" and then "Am I being detained? Am I free to go?" Police need a reason to detain you beyond the normal scope of a traffic stop. Not consenting to a search is not probable cause to detain someone. They can threaten you until they're blue in the face, but as you said, they're trying to get you to trip up, which is why you should stick to "I do not consent to my person or vehicle being searched" and then "Am I being detained?" or "So I am free to go?".
