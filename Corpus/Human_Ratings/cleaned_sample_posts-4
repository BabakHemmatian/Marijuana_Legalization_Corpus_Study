Ok but it wont.http://cannabisculture.com/v2/node/30000May 7 and 8th is his appeal date, written by Mernagh himself. And it is legalization in Canada not Ontario that Mernagh has picked a fight against. To be clear the court is provincial but he is fighting federal law.Even if he wins and, his evidence is more than ample enough to win we will still have to wait for the appeal from the supreme court of Canada.Court decision dates are not the same as hearing dates, it will not be on May 7 and 8th that we will even get a decision that is when his HEARING is.

I got a popup offering to pay me for reviews of things. That entire site has one article and none of the links work properly. Clearly spam. I googled a unique-looking string from it though, [here's the actual article](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Lift-ban-on-cannabis-for-medical-research-Oncologists/articleshow/45723565.cms).

>I'm against the notion of simply "giving" the rights to productize and sell marijuana to big tobacco simply because legalizing it would put a dent in their profits.How would the denting of profits occur?

I know someone who was in the same position. He came clean to his future boss, the guy who hired him, about his legal medical marijuana script and he was totally fine with it. The parent company requires a drug test He did his best to clean up his urine, passed two home tests, failed the company test, and his job offer was rescinded. He complained to HR, and was told there was no appeal process, and he could not retake the test. TL/DR boss doesn't care about medical marijuana use parent company does. Loses job.

Is your problem with victimless crimes or nonviolent crimes? There is a huge difference between grand theft auto and small scale cannabis distribution, yet they are both non-violent crimes. It would be insane if we didn't lock up repeat offenders of nonviolent crimes like grand theft auto.

Make no mistake: you can always be charged for 'impaired driving' regardless of level of alcohol, weed or anything else. They could charge you with it if they thought you were too tired and it was impairing your ability to drive safely. You can also be charged with impaired driving if you're under the legal limit.

>I did let you know that I was arguing for the sake of arguing.When?>Besides, if I wasn't lazy and tired I would have gone on as though I did believe in the side of the argument I had picked, and you would have never known. Then you would have believed you were in an actual argument about genuine beliefs.What's your point? Do you think my point is that I don't want to know about whether your arguments are legitimate or not? Because my point is actually that I don't want to waste my time arguing against fictitious beliefs - regardless of whether I know about it or not.>Besides when I argue for something that I don't particularly believe 100% I learn more about it. So it's for just as many selfish reasons at it is selfless.You mean when you argue things you're unsure about. If you don't believe in right and wrong you can't "not particularly believe 100%" that "nature got weed right" - you simply don't believe it at all. It logically contradicts. You can say you're UNSURE, which may be the word you're looking for.I'll leave the whole "selfless" notion alone...

Good point. The Dutch model involves legalizing marijuana as a 'soft' drug while designating powerful addictive drugs like cocaine as 'hard' drugs and making hard drugs illegal.

There was an FBI report awhile back that the average marijuana arrest cost $7500. Looking for that link! What I am trying to do is get that source. $7500 even sounds low. So what is your guess of how much an 'average cost per arrest" is? Police, booking, etc. One year of jail time cost NYC $167,000 per prisoner, so an arrest cost of $7500 seems way low.Source: Taxpayer cost of housing NYC prisoners last year: $167,000 per inmatehttp://nypost.com/2013/08/23/taxpayer-cost-of-housing-nyc-prisoners-last-year-167000-per-inmate/

I don't think its better to cut first. Increasing revenue first would be the better I think. Revenue increase is not just about increasing tax rates. While government revenue is mostly taxes there are other factors that affect how much is collected. If the economy is doing well and businesses are growing there is more revenue in taxes then if the economy is in a recession. Government action which increases the economy whether through top down (which I think is crap) or down up could increase revenue more then what it costs. Simply "cutting" is not the first solution. The first solution is to try and get them off the programs if possible (which is what many on the right consider government waste). Whether through legislation or incentives getting people off without just changing the qualifications for these programs would reduce their costs. Then see if its possible to reduce the need for certain programs or agencies. An example is legalizing pot which costs the government billions in enforcing the ban on pot would reduce costs a little. Once you go through that I think it would be better to start cutting waste (which while some thing of as waste others need it for jobs) and increasing revenue through increasing tax rates.

Marijuana is illegal because in the 1930's William Randolph Hearst ran a smear campaign to protect his financial interests in the timber industry, since hemp was poised to replace wood as an inexpensive raw material for the manufacture of paper.

*hemp clothes -- linen comes from flax fibers. Hemp clothes actually last much longer. One of the main reasons MJ was outlawed to begin with; cotton lobbying outlawed hemp because it was cheaper to grow and outlasted cotton clothing.

I do not support mandatory minimums in any form but it is more than a little disengenuous to pretend a party must support all mandatory minimums or none at all. Research has shown mandatory minimums do not have an effect on crime reduction, but that does not necessarily mean there is no role for mandatory minimums in the justice system. In addition to the rehabilitation aspect of corrections, there is also a punishment aspect. It simply does not follow that because there is a minimum penalty for first degree murder, that there should also be a minimum penalty for marijuana posession.This issue of mandatory minimums is slightly more nuanced than saying one must either be in favor of mandatory minimums for all crimes or none at all. For example, look at the case of Leroy Smickle. In his case, the mandatory minimum sentence for gun posession was deemed to be cruel and unusual by the Ontario Court of Appeal and was struck down. Remarkably, the court was able to deem one particular case of a mandatory minimum to be unconstitutional, while not simultaneously ruling every single mandatory minimum to be unconstitutional. I am afraid your argument does not hold much water.

I was in court ordered rehab when I was 17, and in there I met the hottest girl I've ever laid eyes on in real life.We were the only 2 in there for smoking weed, so we got along from the start. One day as we were talking I just said, "So when are you going to give me your number?" She wrote it down as soon as I asked. Nothing ever came out of it, but I still got her number, and she is still the hottest girl I've ever seen.

Well, they're not allowed on the streets with a blanket, can't sleep in their car, there are not nearly enough shelter beds. It has to be much cheaper to just imprison them for having a blanket, or trespassing, or smoking the weed that makes them feel better. Hmmm, lets google... Average cost of medicaid, per enrollee, per year: $6000.00Average cost of incarceration, per "enrollee", per year: $21,000.00 (excluding the cost to society)What are we doing?!

Yes it is like driving drunk, you're not 100% yourself, and you're right, it is still illegal, which means that you still shouldn't drive under the influence of marijuana because then it's double penalties. As I said, no matter how much you deny it, Driving High and Driving drunk pose the same probability of an accident on the road.

Funny you should reference real-world behind-the-wheel studies. I remember reading one where the researchers, after observing stoned people driving on a closed track, concluded it would be reasonably safe to do additional studies on public roads, as long as there was a co-driver. I'll try to find it. In the meantime, **"There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance"** - *University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales* **"THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs** - *(Robbe, 1994; Robbe and O'Hanlon, 1995; O'Hanlon et al., 1995)"* - *University of Limburg, Netherlands* **"There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected"** - *University of Adelaide, South Australia* **"marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident"** - *University of Toronto, Canada* **"In two studies with reasonable numbers of individuals who had only used cannabis, there was no clear evidence of increased culpability in these drivers."** - *The Lancet* **"No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis"** - *Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute* **"Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving"** - *Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs* **"The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08"** - *U.S. Department of Transportation Study* **"[Cannabis'] effect on higher cognitive functions, for example divided attention tasks associated with driving, appear not to be as critical. Drivers under the influence of cannabis seem aware that they are impaired, and attempt to compensate for this impairment by reducing the difficulty of the driving task, for example by driving more slowly."** - *"The Influence of Cannabis on Driving," Prepared for Road Safety Division, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, UK, by Transport Research Laboratory, Ltd.*

The first laws against marijuana were enacted in El Paso, Texas around the beginning of the 20th century. It was mainly because the people living in El Paso did not like the Mexican immigrants in the area who smoked it.

> Sales of various pharmaceuticals (and profits of big companies) would see a significant drop.Don't forget the huge hit (*cough*) to tobacco profits. My theory is that the tobacco lobby is the biggest reason for marijuana's prolonged ban in the US.

Another possibility is that people are using cannabis to manage their pain instead of opiates. There are many who use opiates for moderate to severe pain only because they have no other legal option, not because they want some dope. Cannabis can fill this void, particularly for neuropathic pain.

I believe so, what I have seen is 6 plants growing and 6 plants flowering (Dont quote me though)But you should still be able to grow.From Mass. GovAre qualifying patients eligible for marijuana while the program is being implemented?Yes. During the time DPH is implementing this program, the ballot measure allows the written recommendation of a qualifying patient’s physician to serve as a medical marijuana registration card. Similarly, the law allows a qualifying patient to cultivate his or her own limited supply of marijuana during this period. A certifying physician may issue a written certification only for a qualifying patient with whom the physician has a bona fide physician-patient relationship. Under the law, until its program is implemented, DPH is not involved in regulating any recommendations between physicians and patients for the medical use of marijuana, or in defining the limited cultivation registration. DPH has clarified in its final regulations that these provisions of the law will remain in effect until further notice. Even though final regulations are in FAQ on place now, patients may continue to visit physicians for certification, and to possess legally allowable amounts of medical marijuana as defined in the regulations, before DPH’s anticipated online registration system is available.DPH will notify the public on its medical marijuana website, www.mass.gov/medicalmarijuana, when this system is operational and must be used.

To be clear, the penalty for providing marijuana to someone between the ages of 18 to 21 is a maximum of 6 months and a $1000 fine. 14-18 is a maximum 5 years. Under 14 is a maximum 7 years.

Yes yes a thousand times yes!! I have certainly felt this way about myself and it is exactly some of the reasons if not all the reason that I use marijuana. Seeing how I am in a state who's government hasn't jump aboard the legal/medical marijuana boat. I would love to see something like continue.

In the current legal climate where most people have to grow indoor if they want to grow, growing high quality marijuana is way more difficult than brewing beer. Especially considering the start up costs and time/expertise required to build a working room. It takes a ton of work to grow large amounts of marijuana indoors.

Seriously, in my experience dutch people smoke a lot less weed than people from anywhere else. Hardly any of the dutch I've met smoke it. Here in the UK people smoke it a lot more I think. I think having it practically legal makes people not see it as a big deal.

I would rather it not be there but I think it's a great way to publicize the message a bit more, even if this whole thing only makes 200 people rethink marijuana legalization, that's a great thing.Also - I've been busy which means not much time for Reddit anyway.

I don't think it's just a matter of age, as some posters suggest... I've heard young parents talk about how awful it is that youths in the park smoke strong smelling weed near their children, and young cops talk about the horrors of dope-smoking criminals - and at the other extreme, both my parents are in favour of legalisation.

Why not both? At its lowest estimate, cannabis regulation could bring in $100,000,000 to Michigan. But I do agree, the schools need fixing before the roads.Edit: that's a yearly estimate that goes as high as $500 million.

Two reasons: (1) still getting over the last GF; and (2) broke in graduate school.My last GF could not cope with being away from her hometown, never gave mine a legitimate chance, broke many huge promises to me and sat around all day smoking weed. We were LDR for a couple years, then she moved to my city, then she moved back to her hometown "for the summer" before dropping the bomb a couple weeks ago that she would not be returning. I would not be able to move to her hometown for at least two years but was so burned by her broken promises that I had to end it. I no longer want her back but getting over a three-year relationship is not something I can do in two weeks.I have begun moving on by going to some social events and trying OkCupid for the first time but at this point feel like I am doing the latter just to have some idea of the dynamics of the site when I *am* ready for another relationship.That aside, the ladies tend to like men with some earning power and being in grad school probably is not going to help me get any traction.

While I don't agree with every drug the USA has illegal (marijuana,) they are still illegal. If someone does something illegal, or has something that is illegal to have, they're going to do some time. That's just how it is. It doesn't make sense to do something you know you could get in trouble for, and then complain when you do get into trouble.

I agree with that to some degree. It's not all good and it's not completely harmless, but neither is something like alcohol. The fact of the matter is that for some people marijuana is not safe, especially if it's being used heavily, but in my opinion it's a double-standard to say that about marijuana while alcohol is still perfectly legal.

>The only people who claim it's a correct phrase are the people who continue to use it despite it clearly being wrong.This is one of the most grave and naive mistakes a person can make, and it makes it impossible for you to ever evaluate a situation rationally. There are people in the world, although perhaps a small minority, who will stand up for any argument that they see correct and attack any argument they see as wrong, regardless of their opinion on the outcome of the argument. If you cannot identify with these people, it simply means that you are one of the majority, who cannot evaluate an argument based on merit but who can only look at outcomes. It makes you likely a part of the population who shouts "YES!" when any argument is made that supports your point of view, without considering the merits of the argument.Of course everyone is influenced by their emotions and we all use motivated reasoning, but the fact that you think it's impossible for someone to defend a practice unless they take part in that practice is absolutely pathetic and stupid.And for what it's worth, I absolutely *hate* the phrase "I could give a crap" and never use it, and yet have defended it on this page. But this is a minor issue; it's unfortunate that your way of thinking pervades every issue, and often is used to invalidate (in the mind of the foolish person) minority opinions. (The only people who want pot legalized are potheads, for example-- clearly not true, but definitely a major reason that many are not willing to even listen to the arguments presented by legalization proponents.)So please get that foolish notion out of your head, and begin trying to evaluate arguments based on merit-- and unless the other person has expressly presented their opinion to you, please stop assuming that just because they point out weaknesses or strengths in an argument, you can assume you know their point of view.

It means that getting caught with a small amount of weed isn't a criminal offense. It's a simple violation, like a traffic violation. You can get a ticket (around 500 bucks), but you can't get thrown in jail. If you're carrying over an ounce it's criminal, and the penalties are more severe the more you have. Misdemeanor for 1-4 ounces, and felony for anything more. This applies to Oregon only.

Yeah, the biggest upside is that local police won't be going after marijuana users and the feds can't conscript them into enforcing drug laws. If the feds want to enforce these laws, their going to do it on their own dime, which will be a deterrent to fully enforcing the drug laws on the local level.

Mormons are not Christians. No matter how mainstream they become, or how much they use their deep pockets to aggressively market themselves as Christians, they are fundamentally not Christian. Beliefs are important, and just because you accept and believe in the divinity of Jesus does not make you a Christian. After all, Muslims too accept much of the Jesus story, and included in the Qu'ran are stories from the life of Jesus. In fact, you can't be a Muslim without believing in Jesus.Now, even though Muslims believe in Jesus, and accept almost the whole of the Jesus story, no one would argue that they are Christians. This is because there are fundamental differences in belief, and there are certain things a group must believe, or reject, in order that they may be called Christian, Muslim, etc...The beliefs of the Mormon faith do not match up with that of Christianity. Yes, they believe in the resurrection, and the divinity of Christ, but that is not enough to be considered "Christian," especially when they hold a number of other beliefs, that in no way a part of, or present in, Christianity.The best analogy I can come up with off the top of my head is to say, calling Mormonism, "Christian," is akin to calling someone who believes in heavy government regulation and taxation of business, and legalization of marijuana, Libertarian. Yes, they've got one part of being a Libertarian down (keeping government out of what legal adults choose to put into their bodies), but their other beliefs (heavy regulations and taxation of business) so far disqualify them from being a Libertaraian that the term is not apt.

The party voted [in favor of legalization](http://bc.ctvnews.ca/federal-liberals-endorse-marijuana-legalization-1.754350), at our last convention. Since then, Rae has made a big deal out of it. Unless the leader vetoes the policy, it is going to be part of our platform during the next election. Considering a majority of Canadians support our position, I would say that is unlikely.

I don't really get why the OP would think that since weed is legal, these people simply wouldn't exist. I'm pretty sure those people would still be around, they would just find another way to rob people.

I once heard Hearst had a part in this because he owned the process to pulp wood for paper as well as lots of forest land. Hemp was a competitor to paper, so he used his papers to help drum up drug fears --- linkshttp://wafreepress.org/article/090304marijuana.shtmlhttp://blog.mjbud.com/uncategorized/why-is-hemp-illegal-in-the-us/

Nixon's war on drugs was explicitly designed to target the black community. (and anti-war leftists). This is a former aid under Nixon"You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,"John Ehrlichmanhttp://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/

It would be profitable to almost every *government* to legalize.Very many companies have products that cannabis can directly compete with, and if it were made legal in all forms, these companies would either have to spend a large amount of money to convert to new ways of making their products utilizing cannabis or go out of business to the companies who already have ways of using it.

No, they wouldn't be released.As of 1999, we had roughly 60,000 people incarcerated for cannabis crimes:*Nearly 60,000 marijuana offenders are incarcerated in the United States at any given time, according to a study published in the Federation of American Scientists' "Drug Policy Analysis Bulletin." More than a quarter of marijuana offenders are incarcerated for personal possession, with no other drugs involved in the offense.*[Source](http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/095/marijuanaprisoners.shtml)At that time we were arresting roughly 700,000 people per year. We are now arresting closer to 800,000. I suspect there has been an increase in the number of marijuana offenders but it's probably less than 70,000.

Sure - and they also dislike when it is legalization of marijuana and the answer is no.You can't enjoy the good parts of a democracy without accepting the bad parts. Just because you think a behaviour should be socially acceptable doesn't mean the majority *must* agree.It is strange to say, but a tolerant person must be tolerant of intolerance. The solution isn't to force opinions on others but to engage in campaigns to change hearts and minds -- something, I might add, the homosexual community has been successfully doing.

I would prefer that people who support marijuana legalization simply go ahead and support marijuana legalization. It's disingenuous and off-putting to mask support of marijuana legalization with support of industrial hemp.

Throw away your book.[From the US government's website:](http://drugabuse.gov/infofacts/marijuana.html)>**marijuana smoke contains 50-70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke**. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs' exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;6 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.7 Thus, **the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.**It's probably a bit worse than smoking cigarettes ([although some research suggests the opposite is true](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277837/)), but one joint is catagorically NOT equal to 140 cigarettes!

I did this once.I went over to my buddies place, an apartment on the 2nd floor of a house, and he didn't answer the door. So, I opened the unlocked door to go upstairs (this door and the staircase were open to the 3rd floor apartment). I knock on the door super loud as I walk by it and am making up the stairs when I yell out "Officer Barnes hereeeee, it smells a little bit like illegal up here what's goin' on?" in one of my alter-ego-voice-changing-moment-voices. I hear them start scrambling and panicking upstairs at this point, lol.I got to the top of the stairs in time to see one of the group literally throwing a lit spliff in the corner of the room because he thought a cop was about to walk around the corner.Bahahaha.

Really? So you have no opinion on stopping people from ruining their chance at future jobs and colleges because of getting caught with marijuana because their freedom was taken away by being jailed? A lot of people are like you and just don't care because it doesn't effect you. People like you make me fucking sick. You have no idea how much you could help.

> Effects on the LungsNumerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke.

I've had anxiety most of my life, and it's the constant general anxiety, and can turn into acute panic attacks. Most stuff doesn't work all that well since I can't find the root cause to diffuse it, so a purely mental approach doesn't usually work for me. I can't ever really completely clear it out, but certain herbals have helped a bit. I've tried a lot of pharmaceuticals and most don't work, aside from benzodiazepines. Neurontin has helped a little bit with the social aspect, being in more busy crowded areas. Most doctors and psychiatrists tend to have "benzophobic" personalities for whatever reason, so that's not a viable option for many. Marijuana is also a great alternative if it's legal, but it is very expensive in areas with medical marijuana licenses. Herbals that have helped me in the past by taking the edge off, or things I would recommend: Kava root powder, Ashwagandha, N-Aceytl Cysteine, Bacopa Monnieri, Huperzine A, Rhodiola, SAM-e.If your anxiety is coming from problems with GABA, then things like L-Theanine, Passionflower, Picamilon, Valerian, Chamomile, 5-HTP or Tryptophan might help rebalance somewhat. The GABA supplement itself doesn't cross the blood brain barrier for most people, and this didn't have any effect for me when I tried it.Some people can have less neurotransmitter activity because of an MTHFR mutation. Usually the problem is from the body not being able to process folate properly in folic acid form, and a special vitamin can help those people with that specific condition.I use other things in small increments, taking a few days off in between because they have risk of dependency. These ones are Phenibut and Kratom. I cycle off and on these for several days at a times. I'm just speaking from personal experience, and this stuff should be researched and one should get advice from professionals who know about this stuff before trying anything here. Hope you can find ways to help you feel better.

> I thought Federal law trumps all?Kind of? So the Federal Constitution trumps all, and in it there is the Supremacy Clause: > This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be *made in pursuance thereof;* and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. [emphasis added]What that means is that federal law does trump state and local laws if, and only if, they are made in pursuance of the constitution. In other words, there is an argument to be made that, for example, federal laws regulating intra-state activities (those that do not involve interactions with anyone outside the state) are not made in accordance with the constitution's enumerated powers, and thus violate the 10th amendment (which is, itself, a part of the constitution)> The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the peopleThat's why several states are pushing back against gun laws, marijuana laws, the TSA, etc: because those laws are not in pursuance of the US Constitution, they do *not* trump state/local laws, and are in fact in violation of the constitution.Thankfully, what LA is trying to pull here is in clear violation of the 1st, and therefore gets trumped by the Supremacy Clause.
70373064
Yeah, definitely a federal issue. My understanding is that the federal law enforcement has generally relied on local law enforcement to catch violators of local and federal laws. If the local law enforcement says they won't enforce that federal law (carrying weed across borders) then the federal law enforcement agencies have to allocate more resources to make the arrests themselves.

So... all those companies would just use it if it was legal. This "the big companies are keeping it down because it's competition" has always been the stupidest argument. Legalize cannabis, and it wouldn't destroy those companies' business: it would simply become the companies business. Cannabis makes really useful textiles? Well the textile companies would start using cannabis. Cannabis would make tons of industrial products? Gosh, maybe all these huge industrial firms would, you know, make industrial products using it.

> So /r/PussyPass is a pro-feminist subreddit, but would never even start a conversation about how to better it themselves?Well what would it accomplish? They know who they mean when they talk about it, and if anyone there were to try to convince the general populace otherwise, people would assume they're just "a circlejerk who want to stir the TRP/MR/TiA anti-socialjustice pot" or something.So why not just keep doing what they're doing? *They* know they mean "shitty feminists" and not "all feminists", and anyone who can't see that isn't going to have their mind changed by them.> How do you feel about generalizations about men by some feminists?Again, it's about context. Someone saying "men don't think that way" and meaning "most men don't think that way" is fine. Someone saying "men don't think that way" and meaning "it is impossible for any single man to ever think differently" is wrong.The difference is that you assume that everyone in /r/pussypass thinks it's impossible for any feminist to actually agree that there is a problem, and I think that assumption is ridiculous considering that feminists who agree with them exist.> So while you admit they dont distinguish, in their heads they do?Yes. As a result, they don't need to say "only those feminists who disagree on the matter of gender disparity in sentencing" every time they talk about it, because it's assumed when someone says "feminist" that they're talking about the shitty ones.

Namely to be measurable. But also to demonstrate that it's morality, rather than just some random law of physics.That is, in order for morality to *be* morality, there must be some judgement. Whether that be subjective (done by person to person) or objective (some static reference deciding moral things).When it's subjective, there's naturally no 'punishment' that happens if you do something 'bad'. Only the holder of the view could punish you (and if they had the power, they would). This is the legal system. Illegal is "bad" and you are punished. In this sense it's a subjective moral system. Nothing *actually* happens to you when you break the law. People smoke weed all the time and are fine, yet it's against the law.An objective system, on the other hand, necessarily needs to inflict this. Otherwise there's no way to demonstrate it exists. Or that it should be called morality.If something you do inflicts something, that doesn't mean it's morally good/bad. Is eating Vitamin A good morally? No. There's no reward, morally speaking, for this. It simply makes a biological change in your body. There's no objective measure as to whether this is a good or bad thing. The objectivity is that it made a change.As such, I wouldn't call digestion "objective morality". An objective morality would necessarily need to inflict it's decisions on moral rulings.Once you subjectively pick a set of rules, you may then objectively judge them. But the act of picking something as morality is a subjective act in itself. Objective morality would need to make this judgement obvious, and something that clearly defines *itself* as morality. Otherwise it's the same as not existing.

I think we took a wrong turn somewhere. You said:>Well being for slavery, as I interpreted it, would mean being for legal slavery.I interpreted that as "people who would be for slavery, which is illegal, would like to make it legal." That's why I mentioned marijuana. It is illegal, and people that are for it want to make it legal. Same with sex trafficking -- anyone who's for it would probably rather not get arrested for it.
45814576
Indeed. Surprising, no? I must admit that while I enjoyed the study and relatively comprehensive results themselves, there were some word choices that made it clear just where the corporation stood on the subject. Take for instance: *While its health risks are well documented, marijuana also has several potentially beneficial health effects, according to supporters.* Risks are well documented, but the health benefits are only potentialities, and only supported by those already on the side of legalization.

More on the hectic life of Fela Kuti, founder of afrobeat, [available at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti).A brief excerpt of the middle years:> Fela and his band, Africa '70, returned to Nigeria. He then formed the Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio, and a home for many connected to the band that he later declared independent from the Nigerian state. Fela set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, named the Afro-Spot and then the Afrika Shrine, where he performed regularly. Fela also changed his middle name to Anikulapo (meaning "he who carries death in his pouch"), stating that his original middle name of Ransome was a slave name. The recordings continued, and the music became more politically motivated. Fela's music became very popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in general. In fact, he made the decision to sing in Pidgin English so that his music could be enjoyed by individuals all over Africa, where the local languages spoken are very diverse and numerous. As popular as Fela's music had become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was also very unpopular with the ruling government, and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. In 1974 the police arrived with a search warrant and a cannabis joint, which they had intended to plant on Fela. He became wise to this and swallowed the joint. In response, the police took him into custody and waited to examine his feces. Fela enlisted the help of his prison mates and gave the police someone else's feces, and Fela was freed. He then recounted this tale in his release Expensive Shit.> In 1977 Fela and the Afrika ’70 released the hit album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military. The album was a smash hit with the people and infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta Republic, during which one thousand soldiers attacked the commune. Fela was severely beaten, and his elderly mother was thrown from a window, causing fatal injuries. The Kalakuta Republic was burned, and Fela's studio, instruments, and master tapes were destroyed. Fela claimed that he would have been killed if it were not for the intervention of a commanding officer as he was being beaten. Fela's response to the attack was to deliver his mother's coffin to the main army barrack in Lagos and write two songs, "Coffin for Head of State" and "Unknown Soldier," referencing the official inquiry that claimed the commune had been destroyed by an unknown soldier.> Fela and his band then took residence in Crossroads Hotel as the Shrine had been destroyed along with his commune. In 1978 Fela married 27 women, many of whom were his dancers, composers, and singers to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic. Later, he was to adopt a rotation system of keeping only twelve simultaneous wives. The year was also marked by two notorious concerts, the first in Accra in which riots broke out during the song "Zombie," which led to Fela being banned from entering Ghana. The second was at the Berlin Jazz Festival after which most of Fela's musicians deserted him, due to rumors that Fela was planning to use the entirety of the proceeds to fund his presidential campaign.

Yeah. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't read it either."The neonates of heavy-marijuana-using mothers had better scores on autonomic stability, quality of alertness, irritability, and self-regulation and were judged to be more rewarding for caregivers. "They try to suggest other factors give these results - "suggest that the better scores of exposed neonates at 1 month are traceable to the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal development"This means either the effect of Marijuana on unborn children has positive effects or NO negative effects or negative effects so negligible, social-economic factors can overcome them and make them positive. Is it just me or is this big news? Why haven't we heard of this before? This study was done in 1994!

Concealed is concealed. If anyone knows you have a gun before you have to draw it in lawful self defense, you've failed. I legally carry a concealed gun every day, including to parties and to weed deals. No one has ever been able to tell, and only my girlfriend knows.Also, remember it's not yet legal for you to carry concealed. You have to wait and get a permit.

I haven't met, and can't imagine meeting, anyone who goes out of their way to smoke weed just to be rebellious. Every person I've meet that smokes does so because they enjoy smoking. Also, those people always seem to enjoy having more friends to hang out and smoke with. So an increase in people trying weed because it's legal doesn't really seem like it would lead to a decrease in smokers because there are even *more* people to smoke with.

As a big fan of drugs I just want to say to the youngsters out there that Salvia really isn't cool.

Either way, the end of marijuana prohibition is truly inevitable. The issue isn't even really whether public opinion shifts in favor of ending prohibition, though it is shifting. The issue is that prohibition is an unsustainable policy. But if Mexico goes ahead with legalization, I'll think we'll see prohibition end sooner in the US.

I know what an analogy is.You have given me analogies.But there is a difference between analogies and working analogies. Which I believe I already explained.Regardless, the water analogy would fall short for those reasons.It's usually not a good idea to use an analogy that can be seen as incorrect, and then say "nah, this is right, you're wrong" whenever the other person points out why the analogy doesn't apply.For those reasons, the wine analogy works better than the water analogy.I'm honestly just trying to help here. Everyone in support of marijuana should use the strongest arguments they can. Stating simply 'you're wrong' (or insisting on a single point and ignoring others) and then walking away is usually seen as a lazy argument, and does nothing but confirm the stereotypes that the opposition has about the pro-legalization community.

Melatonin is released endogenously by your body to induce sleep, as well as help regulate it. I'm not aware of any studies to back back it up, but it seems to make sense that since it is known that cannabis alters your sleep cycles, melatonin would help counter this. It's definitely worth a try.I will say though, if you're not too familiar with it, take it immediately before you go to bed. I say this because if you take it, and then power through the drowsiness, it actually makes it much harder to fall asleep for me. Also, I'd suggest taking it on a night where you won't have to wake up early the next morning. I personally find that if I take it and then wake up before getting enough sleep (generally around 8-9 hours) that I feel drowsy throughout most of the day. But with that being said, it is a very helpful compound in that it gives you very restful sleep.

No. This was His plan all along, to make a people for Himself and to do so in the most profound display of love in His created world, death on behalf of loved ones. If God IS love, it makes sense that He would have the greatest showing. Your logic is off. If there is a God it is foolish for you to even begin to question the Creator. (Romans 9, does the pot say to the potter "Why have you made me this way?") When you read a good story like 'The Lord of the Rings', are you asking… "why didn't Tolkien just start the book of with them at Mount Doom? Why did they have to go through all of that suffering? Why did he choose a Hobbit and not a warrior? That's ridiculous!" No. The author has the right to tell his story how he sees fit. In the same way God is the author of THE story and this is how He chose to write it. He also explains in His Word that people who have not been "born again" spiritually (only possible by an act of His grace) will think His plan is "ridiculous" (see verse below). This was God's plan all along. We didn't thwart an original plan and we didn't surprise Him. He doesn't a parallel adversary. He is Sovereign King over the universe, the beginning and the end. The Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians 1:17-31"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written:“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”[c]20 Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22 Jews demand signs and Greeks *(everyone else)* look for wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.26 Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28 God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 29 so that no one may boast before him. 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”*italics mine

this doesn't matter. by joining the military you serve the military complex and do your job on helping other to kill people.Just have a look what american soldiers do in afgahnistan, iraq and so on. Have they yet found some weapons of mass destruction in iraq? By joining the forces YOU are a part of americas killing/exploiting in the world (suppose you are american).When you join, YOU are a part of the forces that torture [people.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse)And then you can be proud to fight the glorious war on [Terror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_War_on_Terror).You can then invade iran, syria and all the other oil countrys. Please reconsider your decision. I'd rather live in aworld where everyone smokes pot, than i a world where everyone joins the army. What do you think?

there are only a small minority of people that want all guns banned in this country...but there are plenty of ways common sense gun control could make this country safer...the problem is the NRA fights any and all gun control the same as if it was a bill stripping American's of all weapons. Also comparing smoking pot to gun control is a pretty flimsy comparison. BTW I am a gun owner...there actually are plenty of us that think you can shoot for sport, hunt and protect a house while cracking down gun crime, and limiting the types of weapons available.

all I know is they have to have probable cause or driver's consent to search the car. If you deny them the clearance (simply say, "I do not consent to any searches" at any mention of the cop entering your vehicle) to search your car and they can't find any probable cause (even something as stupid as red eye or smell) then they can still call in a K9 unit for backup. At this point ask the cop if you are being detained, you most likely are, but if he says no then you are free to go. If you do have to stay around for the dog to show up, it is legally allowed to sniff around the car, he will most likely pick up your weed giving probable cause to search your car and then you are most likely screwed.

My apologies for not knowing the name of the country Darfur is in, but African politics has frustrated me so much all my life, that I simply don't read the articles any more.Guerrilla movement performs a half coup, disabling or hindering the official government. Then said Guerrilla group spends next decade stealing the supplies we send for the innocent people of the country.Eventually there will be some peacekeeping force sent in, but it will be much too late, their economy will a shambles. Then we have adverts to adopt pot bellied african kids on TV for another 10 years.That isn't to say they don't have my deepest sympathies. But when I know my government will intervene, regardless of the cash raised by independant charities, using my tax money to pay for it. Then I have little need to donate.Paramountly though, the "Your donation will fund our crucial awareness and advocacy programs" can at best be interpretted as "We'll use your $2500 donation to fly around the country talking to politicians that already know whats going on". There is no reference to direct aid from the donations that I can see. So you're money is going into the wallet of some green peace jack-off that wants to ban steak...

Soooo, since alcohol has been proven time and again to be a poison in every way (albeit a fun poison), and since cannabis has been proven to be nothing of the sort (the exact opposite of alcohol, apparently), why exactly are things still the way they are regulations-wise?Not that I think any government should ever be allowed to dictate what you can or can't put into your body, but wouldn't it make waaay more sense to regulate the booze and let people consume cannabis at will?

So when they brought him to the hospital for the piss-test, they have to film you actually peeing into the cup. Since they have to watch you, apparently they also have to film you down here. If they film it, it's public record by law.

I've just found the Portuguese stats. The interesting fact is that the lifetime usage went up while the annual usage was stable. This suggests more people experimenting but no more habits being formed.Also cannabis use dropped a fair chunk (on an annual basis) among the youngest user group.Another interesting stat is for the older groups all drug use increased slightly (annually).Regardless the stats show a huge decrease in death rate. We're talking about a 50% drop https://fullfact.org/factchecks/Portugal_decriminalisation_drugs_effects-3276

Far from united? Almost every single American citizen considers themselves as American. That's the amazing part. The US has the most immigrants in the world, and is the most ethnically diverse country in the world, but yet almost everybody that lives in the US, considers themselves as American.And as for marijuana legalization, over 55% of Americans support legalization, compared to only 30% during the 1990s. You have no idea what you're talking about.

>Like what are we supposed to think of gays, what if when i have a son he becomes gay? Do i try to persuade him to become straight?There is not one hegemonic Christian interpretation of this. Some Christians recommend loving gays and lesbian, while still thinking it is a sin, while others (such as myself) are staunchly pro-gay. I personally believe same-sex marriages should be sanctified by the Church.>And why does God say that "the only way to me is through my son", does this mean that if you don't believe and follow Jesus Christ then you would not be permited to heaven?Actually, a Jewish man wrote that, not God.>Is it wrong if i think im agnostic? Because i do believe in a God, and i do believe that there is only one God not multiple (like in ancient egyptian/greek religions).Agnostics doubt the existence of God, so I doubt you are agnostic.>And is smoking pot or doing drugs against out religion?Christian ethics generally advocate moderation. While I would not recommend taking drugs for secular reasons, so as long as drugs do not become habitual I do not perceive it as anti-Christian. >And why would it be wrong to get a tattoo or piercings? And if altering the body is against out religion then why do girls still pierce their ears?It is not wrong.

A question for our (US) presidential and vice-presidential candidates:The prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s created a black market in which organized crime flourished. Al Capone had his heyday. Ending the prohibition of alcohol eliminated to large extent the black market, and undercut organized crime.Today marijuana is prohibited, and the lucrative black market is the source of major profits for organized crime. Marijuana is a less addictive substance than alcohol, and like alcohol is used responsibly by a majority of the people who indulge in it. Why don't we undercut organized crime now as we did back then, by ending prohibition and moving to a system of state-based regulation? What has worked for alcohol will work for marijuana, and organized crime can be hit hard by cutting off its major source of profit.

ATTENTION ALL REDDITORS: If you are charged with misdemeanor pot possession in Cook County know that the prosecutors will NOT be able to prove their case in court. They never force the chemists to come to court on misdemeanor pot cases because they are too busy.So, as long as you plead NOT GUILTY and refuse to STIPULATE to the laboratory tests, the states attorneys will dismiss the case. They will attempt to get you to plead guilty for drug school or some BS but don't. JUST PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND RUN.

since high school alot of my friends have been smoking weed and i don't really care as long as they don't expect me to hang out with them when they are going to smoke and so far they smoke when they want to smoke and i don't really care.

Do you have a management company? IANAL, but can imagine a management company taking on that risk themselves, and being a sort of release for the actual owner. As in, the owner could possibly sue for any losses due to failure on the part of the company. (so use a company with assets...)Re: California marijuana. Probably nothing to worry about unless they've turned it into a major grow house. :D Aside from that, have you looked into holding the house in a trust or corporate entity, rather than as a personal asset subject *to your personal legal issues? All depends on your situation, but if it's substantial money, might be worth looking into.

The reason why this happens is not that AstraZeneca has managed to convince people with unipolar depression that they in fact have bipolar disorder or even that they are trying to do so. Some - probably bogus - studies have suggested that Seroquel can be used as an adjunctive to SSRIs to improve their efficacy. My understanding of pharmacology doesn't suggest such an effect, but on the other hand, I do not have a PhD in medicine. It is also useful in some cases as a treatment for insomnia and there is no calling into question its somnolent effect (although one can, for various reasons, very well question whether or not it promotes deep, restful sleep - not the least of which being that it can cause swelling of the nasal passages which is extremely uncomfortable).If there is one desirable effect of Seroquel for depressed or neurotypical people, however, it's that with long-term usage or high doses it can give rise to dopamine receptor upregulation, thereby enhancing libido and increasing one's sensitivity to amphetamines and other dopamingergics (that includes marijuana).It's pure hell being on the drug, though. It can produce severe dysphoria and will (temporarily of course) make you extremely stupid, unmotivated, and generally give you a majority, if not all, of the negative symptoms of Schizophrenia. (When I say "negative symptoms" I don't mean "bad symptoms" (although they are bad) but rather symptoms which are produced by low dopamingergia in certain parts of the brain.)Edit: Oh, do NOT under any circumstances combine Seroquel with any dopamingergic.

100% who plead get convicted. The percent who don't are those who win in trial or get a case dismissed.The reason for high conviction rates is because prosecutors give maximum statutory sentences if you take it to trial and lose.Some people have criticized this as making most defendants ignore their right to trial.Say your a first time offender for marijuana or something and they offer you a year and you want to go to trial and then they threaten to give you 10 if you go to trial.. You would plead guilty even if you were innocent right?The federal courts can also suppress and disallow evidence that state courts cannot.

What's interesting here isn't just that Bitcoin is being used, but how:>The special sauce that sets apart Tokken is that every transaction will be recorded on the ledger underlying the Bitcoin system — known as the blockchain. Because transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable, pot dispensaries and banks will have a reliable and complete record of all Tokken transactions, including the specifics of each transaction — without requiring any Bitcoins to change hands (a tiny portion of a Bitcoin will be sent between Tokken accounts in order to record the transaction on the blockchain).>>Mr. Zarrad hopes that the transparency offered by Tokken’s blockchain backbone will make banks feel comfortable opening up accounts for the start-up. He is planning to approach some of the banks he previously regulated and is hoping that his background will convince them that he understands the compliance issues they are facing.

He does need probable cause. Pulling you over for speeding or whathaveyou does not constitute probable cause. Now, the cop can say "Hmm I smell weed." or pull out a drug dog and cause it to look like it got a "hit", but that then takes it out of your hands. Basically, if you say no, the cop has no right to search your car without at least making something up. And if he makes something up that can be challenged in court (and if won, the evidence will get thrown out). If you say "go right ahead" anything the cop finds can and will be used against you no matter what.

Not sure about there, would like to assume like California at midnight. So already. Here we can't legally buy it, since no licensed stores exist but you can receive it as a gift if you're 21+. So you can buy a cool container from someone. And they van give you weed as a thank you gift 😋

Marijuana does not fund the Mexican Drug War - Marijuana Prohibition does.If they would legalize it - no one would have to shoot anyone to get it - or control its sale. The only reason they fight over it, is because by making it illegal we make it insanely profitable. Legalize it - and the profit goes away.Amazing to me how quickly people forget alcohol prohibition, and [The St. Valentine's day Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Valentine%27s_Day_massacre). As soon as they repealed prohibition, the wars over control of the distribution of alcohol stopped. Prohibition, led to massive corruption, and organized crime, and continued marijuana prohibition is doing the same thing today.

I would like to point out that you are never obligated to consent to any search by law enforcement, unless it is on a traffic stop and the Officer has probable cause for a search. The Officer can only perform a pat down for weapons, but needs a search warrant to search your person or belongings. I am assuming the Officer asked to search your backpack and you said "yes". Otherwise, it was an illegal search and seizure. If it went to trial you could suppress the contraband as evidence because it was illegally seized. So many people do not know their rights under the constitution. Unless the Officer has a warrant, you can say "I do not consent to any searches." On traffic stops, if an Officers smells an odor of marijuana, he can conduct a search of the vehicle without your consent. Any other time, they MUST have a search warrant!!

"Bitcoin and the unbankables"Many people in the first world are unbankable - banks don't want to do business with them, they can't get a credit card or a loan because of their profession (adult actors), the business they run (medicinal marijuana stores), or their history (bankruptcies). Similar, there is a new strain of unbankables - the Bitcoin businesses. Despite complying with all regulations, many Bitcoin businesses can't get a bank account or have their current ones shut down.Banks are needed to function in today's world - to transfer money, to hold money, etc. Cutting people off from the banking services is like cutting them from the utilities.Since Bitcoin is an inclusive technology, it allows the unbankable to do everything the banking sector offers without the fear of being shut down, without the fees or red tape. This should be the core of the story - talking about how Bitcoin solves the problems of the unbankables and how banks impose their agenda on the money.

Look, it really is very simple. If you infringe on a human right then it is criminal; if not then not. I have a right to freedom, the law against weed infringes on that right. Every human right comes at the expense of a freedom. In exchange for the right to not be stolen from you give up the freedom to steal; in exchange for the right to not be assaulted you give up the freedom to assault, in exchange for the right to have sex with anyone you like you give up the freedom of denying another their choice (obviously necessitating mutual consent), in exchange for the right to speak you give up the freedom to gag another, etc. Every actual right we have follows this simple formula (life is not a right, we all eventually lose it, but defending it IS a right). And laws exist to protect our rights, otherwise they are not valid. What right does the law against weed protect?

[Civil rights, antiwar "hippies" and black people in general.](http://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/)From John Erlichman:>“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

> How could you have any sort of functional society if your rights could be taken away by the whim of some dictator or a vote of society?For an example I will point out.... every society that ever existed or ever will exist. How long do you think you would live if society decided you have no right to life? Your right is absolutely dependent on the collective will of society. Mosquitoes do not have that right, because we have not granted it to them. Domesticated animals have a shadow of that right, because we have chosen to give it to them.> I take it you don't believe in any sort of natural rights.I don't even know what natural rights are, and I wager you don't either.> Why do we need to agree on them as a society? Why is what the majority thinks the best/right thing to do? History shows time and time again the great flaw in this line of thinking...Outside of culture the idea of a best or right action has no meaning. There is no objective standard we can point to. I can agree with you that the certain laws of certain societies were flawed and not the best or right thing to do without claiming that my opinion is based on an objective standard that doesn't exist. The people in the societies you spoke of were likely just as sure as you are that their ideas of right and wrong were objective truth. That is the danger of pretending to knowledge we don't have. Do you doubt that people in some societies would see your economic ideas as barbaric? Society improves through open dialog and the exchanging of ideas.> I believe only what I can rationalize for myself.I have not seen you rationalize anything. What is the rationalization for natural rights, and how did you select the rights to go in that category. You claimed that we should not allow them to be dictated by monarchs or determined by society, yet you turned to the founding fathers as your only support.> But if society (or dictator, or whoever), dictated that these in fact were not rights, would you accept that and move on?No, I would not. I have my own ideas of right and wrong, and I would continue to advocate for them if I were able. Rejecting an objective standard does not mean that I don't think some ways of doing things work better than others. I believe for various reasons that smoking pot ought to be legal, and I will advocate for that. But for today we don't have that right because society has withheld it. (The details of why I believe it should be legal would take us off course, but I would be happy to discuss it in a different thread if you wish. For this discussion the important thing is that I base it on subjective values that are almost universally held.)> As I've expressed above, I do believe in natural rights.You are continuing to make self-referential arguments. Where do natural rights come from? If you have no answer to this then we have no basis for discussion. Are you a theist who believes they are sent from God? Then I have no answer without entering a discussion of theology. I would be more than willing, but do not want to launch off topic if this is not the case. Do you think there is some other origin? Then tell me what it is and we can discuss it. But I don't know how to respond to the idea that natural rights must exist because without them we would have no natural rights.> Could you elaborate more on where you think rights come from?I don't think I can improve much on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/i3n3j/are_beliefs_a_choice/c21aarx) post I made in another discussion. (At least not without more time than I have ATM.)I believe rights come from those in power because I see no other place for them to come from. That doesn't mean I don't wish it were otherwise. But I also know that pretending an objective authority exists when it does not will cause intellectual and moral stagnation. We can't get better if we don't change, and we can't change if we pretend our current point of view represents objective truth. I guess we can't get worse either, but I don't want to live in fear and denial.

We wouldn't need so many prisons if we didn't give people hard time for marijuana-related crimes and petty theft.

I think more of us are libertarian than we realize.At least from people I've talked to- most conservatives are conservative for fiscal/economic reasons, and most liberals are liberal for social reasons.I agree. I'm more for smaller government, more economic freedom, but I don't like being classified solely as republican/conservative because of their views on social issues like gay marriage, abortion, legalization of marijuana, etc.

Psychedelics are really about all I'm interested in. I recently discovered booze after a long tenure in prudishness, and it's just fantastic. I think weed and shrooms look like a hell of a lot of fun, but I kinda want to pace myself so I don't do anything stupid and I also really don't want to get arrested.

Back in the late 80's as I was working at about 3 am in a knitting mill in a small town with my buddy and we're alone staring out the window bored. All of a sudden this guy comes running out of the apartment about 100 ft away with a couple of old open cardboard boxes. He literally throws them without looking into the back seat of his car slams the door and runs around and jumps into the drivers seat and rips out of there tires spinning. All this is in the span of about 15 seconds including the time of coming down the stairs of the building he was in.About 40 seconds later the house is surrounded by about 5 police cars with their blues all on and they proceed to surround the house, pounding on the door of the apartment he came out of and shining flashlights into the window.Found out the next day from the grapevine the guy was selling small amounts of weed and it was a drug bust and someone had called him less than 3 minutes before the bust was supposed to happen and if he had been even 30 seconds later he would have been arrested. We just stood there looking out the windows of the factories second floor staring for like 10 minutes before we remembered, "we were baked", that the knitting machines were still running.

Why is this in /r/jobs? This is sensationalist nonsense, has nothing to do with job advice, job market, etc.If it's against company policy to fail a drug test for marijuana metabolites, then you lose your job if you fail the test. Most states are at-will so you can lose your job for any or no reason, as long as it doesn't include discrimination, and last time I checked, having some pain doesn't count as a disability.Marijuana being legal means she's not arrested for possession, that's it.
75335641
The problem I see with that is the fact that there are some legitimate medical uses that have NOTHING to do with recreational use. There are several strains that have virtually none of the compounds that get you high, but are extremely effective at reducing anxiety, treating seizure disorders, etc.It seems ridiculous to punish patients who could actually benefit from the medicinal properties of marijuana by refusing to decouple recreational use from legitimate medical uses.

I agree that the number of possession cases is only going to increase in the foreseeable future, and I also agree that the court system is very overburdened.However, if marijuana defendants know they have a solid chance at a nullification, they will begin to opt for jury trials. Remember, it is the defendants, not the prosecutors or courts, that decide what goes to trial and what doesn't.
