### call the parsing function

# NOTE: If NN = False, will pre-process data for LDA.
# NOTE: If write_original = True, the original text of a relevant comment -
# without preprocessing - will be saved to a separate file
# NOTE: If clean_raw = True, the compressed data files will be removed from disk
# after processing
# NOTE: Relevance filters can be changed from defaults.py
# NOTE: If there is partial record on file, e.g. including some months in the
# desired range, but not all, delete the aggregated text files resulting from
# previous parsing manually before running the function again.These files can be
# identified by not having a certain month in their filenames and depending on
# parameter settings can include: author, sentiments, lda_prep, nn_prep,
# original_comm, original_indices, Random_Count_Dict, Random_Count_List,
# random_indices, RC_Count_Dict, RC_Count_List, total_count and votes

# language detection)
# NOTE: Requires original text of comments to be available on disk
# NOTE: Should be separately run for LDA and NN, as their preprocessed comments
# are stored in separate files
# NOTE: Performance is significantly worse for shorter posts. By default,
# the filtering is only performed on posts that contain at least 20 words

# TODO: Run the function for alternative sentiment estimates after this

# available, the following function retrieves alternative sentiment measures
# (from NLTK's Vader and CoreNLP)

# NOTE: Make sure that Stanford CoreNLP's Python package is unzipped to the
# same directory as this file and CoreNLP_server.py is also available before
# running this function.

### Train and Test the LDA Model ###
ldam.get_model()

### calculate a lower bound on per-word perplexity for training and evaluation sets

# NOTE: This is a slow, serial function with no method for looking for previous
# estimates. Check the file named Performance in the output folder manually
# and comment out if estimates already exist

### Determine Top Topics Based on Contribution to the Model ###

# NOTE: There is a strict dependency hierarchy between the functions that come
# in this section and the next. They should be run in the order presented

### go through the corpus and calculate the contribution of each topic to comment content in each year

## Technical comments

# NOTE: The contribution is calculated over the entire dataset, not just the training set, but will ignore words not in the dictionary
# NOTE: Percentage of contributions is relative to the parts of corpus for which there WAS a reasonable prediction based on the model
# NOTE: For the LDA to give reasonable output, the number of topics given to this function should not be changed from what it was during model training
# NOTE: Serial, threaded and multicore (default) versions of this function are available (See Utils.py)
# NOTE: Even with multiprocessing, this function can be slow proportional to the number of top topics, as well as the size of the dataset

# NOTE: If write_original was set to False during the initial parsing, this
# function will require all the original compressed data files (and will be much
# slower). If not in the same directory as this file, change the "path" argument
# NOTE: This function ignores comments in the incels subreddit, as no vote info
# for this banned subreddit exists in the source dataset
