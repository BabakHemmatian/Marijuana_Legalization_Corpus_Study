# Marijuana_Legalization_Corpus_Study
This study, in collaboration with [Sloman Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/slomanlab/) and [AI Lab](https://brown.edu/Research/AI/people/carsten.html) at Brown University, involves applying unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to examine temporal trends in discourse about marijuana legalization on Reddit from 2008 until the end of 2018.

Acknowledgment: The basis for the code in the current repository is [this](https://github.com/BabakHemmatian/Gay_Marriage_Corpus_Study]) study on same-sex marriage discourse, which was developed in collaboration with Sabina J. Sloman from Carnegie Mellon University, and Steven A. Sloman and Uriel Cohen Priva from Brown University.
