23190,1,"I got that. But I don't know why? Sure you can argue making weed is pretty easy. True, very little to do apart from watering a plant. But you can't argue weed is as accessible as alcohol in our society. While easy enough to get, when I go to a reception they will offer me a glass of cava or something, not a joint (although an interesting concept on its own). That's a big difference. And yes, it's part of cultural heritage on a lot of places where that plant is native, but not over here. Plenty of tribes get exceptions from local drug laws because of this, but that doesn't make any more a part of our culture then drinking tea at 4. Which is, well, also not at a part of our local culture and traditions. Many cultures have banned alcohol from their society for cultural and religious reasons. But our priests simply liked their wine, Trappists and what not.> There are no economical reasons to justify the war on drugs either.Totally true.

This sub is weird about it because they're a major brand name and ""expensive"" but it works for a lot of people, and it's a clean, safe brand. The small bottles are expensive, yes, but anyone who is on it long term should buy the big Advanced 100ml anyways (which is what I recommend doing if you like it) because the price is brought down significantly per mg.It won't make you feel high at all.

63809,1,"So, I have an update on my family situation. To catch those who don't know, up to speed, I'll give a quick run down:I have 2 kids with a woman, and while she always had a bad temper, and acted beyond inappropriately when angered, it was actually a manageable situation, until the second trimester of the second pregnancy, that I fully realized how bad her mental state is. She has BPD, and did some horrible, horrible things to me when she was angry while pregnant, and got angry over the smallest things.I figured after the pregnancy was over, and any post pregnancy issues were gone, things would go back to normal. Nope, and in some ways she got worse; she would routinely scream at me in front of the children because she knew that that's the quickest way to piss me off. She also developed a bad drug habit, ""attempted"" suicide and/or threatened it a bunch, would force me to stay up when I would want to go to bed, to ""prove I loved her"", and was still occasionally physically abusive. I finally had enough and moved.I moved out on October 10th, and that was the last time she let me see them, and it was months before I got a reply from her, after I begged to see our daughter on her birthday.During this time, I was looking for work/waiting to get hired, and I contacted a lawyer to get my name on the birth certificates (long story, but she did me dirty on each of those situations), and to get partial custody, while gladly giving her child support payments*. The idea had been to keep us separate, and wait for her inevitable relapse, or crazy behavior, and eventually get full custody. Well, when we started talking again, I realized I didn't have the heart to do that, and briefly thought that maybe *this time*, after I've saved a lot of money from this job, and bought my own house up north, she'd take her therapy seriously, and we could live happily ever after. Well, it wasn't even a full week into us talking a bunch, before she snapped on me for not doing what she wanted. If you only respond to one part of this comment, please make it this next part:So, she had talked me into getting weed for her, and the plan was for her to come down, she could get her stuff, and we could spend the night together. The only issue was that her vehicle might not make the 4 hours south, and the 4 back, but she could get her mom's car and make it happen. Well, immediately following the 2nd/final interview with this company (I got hired, yaay), she drops a bomb: her mother said she wouldn't let Jamie drive the car, but *she* would drive the round trip to pick it up. Quick review: I haven't seen her or the kids since October, and we were gonna spend the evening together, discuss our situations and plans, and have sex (It's been since early October and I haven't had the urge to sleep with another woman besides her, since early 2014. I know it's been that long for her, and she'd been dropping some strong hints she was wanting to have sex). One thing I've learned about dealing with her BPD, is that if we spend considerable amounts of time apart, she gets paranoid about if I love her/what she's up to, and at the same time, if she were to come down, even for a night, that would buy me at least another month or two before she'd snap on me again. With all of that said, obviously there's not a snowball's chance in hell I would be cool with her mom coming here and picking up the weed. I told her as such, and she said that's what she figured, but we'd have to figure something out. Between the time I started up my car, and getting home, she snapped, because that was the only way she could get the weed quickly. She started saying that I was going to smoke it all (I *can't* and won't smoke weed at this point. I'm subject to random tests at any time going forward), that I didn't care about her, and she was going to quit talking to me for a month. I tried calming her down, but she was too far gone at this point. She ended up blocking me on Facebook (the only way we were able to communicate), and left me a bunch of random shit, mostly lies. So.... I had an epiphany on how to go forward from here. My two options were to suck up to her and work that way to get to see the kids, the other was the aforementioned lawyer method. Well, my epiphany was to do a little of both. I'm contacting a lawyer to get my name on the birth certificates, give her the child support she'd need (again, I've always paid for things, and it's literally impossible to give someone money when you can't contact them), and at worst, get a weekend with the kids a month. The thing about her has always been that if she *can* use anything and everything as leverage against me, she would. There's also no way in hell she could handle even a day without the kids, so, I would actually have leverage over her, because I told her in the past, that if she took me to court, that there's no way in hell she'd be allowed in my house when I had the kids. I know it sounds like a crazy gamble to think I could take her to court, to get my rights installed, but the few times I was able to dictate how things would go, she quickly learned how to play ball, because she'll never actually let me go. So, my plan is to contact the lawyer, spend some time with her, and delicately letting her know right before the lawyer gets ahold of her, that I'm making my rights as a parent official. She'll get pissed off, but will quickly calm down when I let her know that I'll allow her to come with the kids whenever they do, and that I'm not at all planning on being done with her/or use some of the crazy, documented shit I have, against her. I realized this is the best possible situation, because this will force her to respect me even when she's angry, and with me not wanting to be done with her, she'll have every bit of motivation to go to a therapist and take it seriously. Even if I'm wrong, that this is a bad idea, and she won't try to do anything, after I move up there, and we give the family life another try, only for her to just continue with her craziness, well at least I'll have done everything I could, to make it work, *and* I'll have already had one foot in the door with the legal system. Long as hell comment, I know, but just had to get this off my chest. It really sucks to not see her and the kids, but one way or another, that's about to change, and despite the situation and everything I've gone through with her, I'm genuinely happy/optimistic, I'm about to start working, so I won't have so much damn time on my hands, going forward. One last thing, about the weed situation:Whenever both she and I would smoke when we lived together, unless the kids were spending the night with her parents, only one of us would smoke, and it would be after both of them went to bed. She's currently living with her parents, so even when she would smoke, her parents (really just her father. Her mom smokes as well) will be sober in case one of the kids get up and need attention/affection in the middle of the night, or god forbid, need to go to the hospital. It's always been important for us that at least one of us was stone cold sober in case we had an emergency, and we both feel very strongly about never letting the kids see us intoxicated in any way, whatsoever. The reason for this clarification is that I don't want anyone to think that either of us are irresponsible with the kids; she always picked fights with me, but even with that, our main goal in life is to make sure that the kids are taken care of, appropriately *she's always accused me of never caring about her or the kids, but it was my money that paid for everything, and *she* was the one who would disappear for days on end when angry, with the only working car we had, so me and the kids were stuck at home)

68508,1,"Agreed, but it DEFINITELY depends on your counselor... And clinic I guess.I have an*AWESOME* freaking counselor (everyone says he's the best at my clinic, which is small. Less than 150 patients, I think they have 4 counselors that split the load. I've met 3 others and everyone seems nice tbh)... He actually gives a shit about me and all of his patients. I've said this before but shit... When I go meet him for our monthly, we probably talk on average of ~35-45mins before he even gets on the computer and we get through the mandatory same ol bs pretty quick. But before that, he asks me about how things are going at my job/my relationship with my girlfriend/relationships with my parents and siblings/lots of talk about how probation is going (should actually be completing the ""*5 years*"" of probation in about 3 and a half if things go as planned 😊 and then the 5th deg. possession felony drops to a misdemeanor thanks to the stay of imposition)/he makes sure I'm getting competent care from my psychiatrist and therapist and am actually getting something out of therapy. And somehow we usually end up talking MN sports for a bit too. He's a straight shooter, and will answer any questions I have that may be kind of grey area. After asking for my UA test results in the beginning of my time at this clinic (on paper) I noticed they don't even test for thc period. Which is odd here in MN. I've been behind people who most definitely just got done smoking on their way there waiting to check in and wondered... But I noticed they test for 25-30+ different substances and well, nothing thc related. Synthetic shit yeah, but no actual cannabis.So I asked him about it and he straight up told me it helps people as they're tapering down, although he's obviously not going to suggest I start smoking cannabis again after years and years. He also just told me straight up that If something happens and I ""fall"" and make a *mistake*... That I *CAN* tell him in confidence, and nothing will happen. If I get told I need to take a UA when they scan my card at check in (now at phase 7 the only REAL random UAs I'll have are bottle checks which might happen once a year, might happen 4-6 times I guess it's just up to their computer algorithm) and I know it'll be dirty, he always said it's best to be honest that day and just let them know what they might get back from the lab....but say for example someone just had a clean UA and then the week after, they shoot some dope or smoke some crack... *My counselor* specifically, I can't speak for any others, would rather have you tell him than say nothing. That way they can figure out if maybe your dose isn't taking care of cravings like it should, and raise it as needed. Idk he's been pretty open with me about stuff like that... He'd rather know and try to help than not know and not be able to do jack shit about it. And if it **is** because their dose is too low, it could just lead to more than one relapse and then continued use... Who knows. I've heard people in the queue openly talk about going to the clinic in the morning to get their 40mg dose that keeps the wd away and gives them a boost, and then they leave to go hustle and score some dope and get high. Every single day.I'm sure those people don't last very long because they obviously don't want help at all. It's crazy what people will say in that queue

138844,1,"""How does medical marijuana differ from recreational marijuana?While medical marijuana has some regulations in terms of formulation and dispensing, all forms of legal marijuana are required to meet specific standards for potency, concentration and purity. While recreational marijuana will also be subject to some regulations, it will contain less of the medicinal cannabidiol and more of the THC, which recreational marijuana users seek out for its euphoric effect. Clearly, these safeguards are not in place for illegally acquired marijuana.""That's not how its played out in Colorado, I wonder where the author got this information. In Colorado a dispensary will have a room where mother plants are maintained for cloning. Literally the only difference between cannabis destined for the counter on one side of the room labeled ""medical"" versus the other side of the room labeled ""recreational"" is the color of the tax tag attached to the stem. They are typically grown in exactly the same, optimized way, harvested and dried in exactly the same way and sold the same way. We can argue about the variability in cannabinoid and terpene distribution based on the crop produced because that does vary even with very nearly identical growing techniques but at least in Colorado the bud you buy at one counter is the same bud that you buy at the other counter.Also the assertion of causation by the author regarding cannabidiol as medicinal versus THC apparently being something different isn't based on the evidence. The entourage effect is likely playing a role in any perceived therapeutic benefit and anecdotally people make treatment decisions which result in treatment patterns that suggest THC is beneficial for some complaints while CBD is beneficial in others. Based on pharmacokinetics alone, when I see repeated dosing every three hours I think THC but when I see different patterns I think about a different pharmacokinetic profile. The authors points about kids being exposed is perfectly valid and I agree completely, same with driving.

However much the standard user enjoys in a session (a brownie? A couple of joints? I honestly have no idea) is probably the more important metric, when compared to an average person's night at the bar (I also have no idea how much people need to get drunk, for that matter); comparing those two, I suspect marijuana is still safe*r*, though I have no idea if it would be reasonable to consider it safe. Though *that* said, marijuana is still widely used despite its legality, and I haven't heard about a big DUI problem with baked drivers - even if it can't easily be tested for, it's obvious enough when someone's high, even after an accident.Eh, just a few thoughts of mine on the matter; don't feel like you have to spend much time thinking about them, since I didn't either.

244142,1,"Brief clarification: federal prosecutors are actually prohibited from using DoJ funds to ""prevent states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws"" by a rider attached to every appropriations bill since 2013 (i think it's section 538 of the omnibus act this year). Courts have interpreted as a prohibition on bringing federal charges against anyone who is in compliance with their state marijuana laws. That means if you're in possession of more than the legal limit, selling outside the legal channels (which includes selling at all in DC, for instance), running a grow op that's larger than your state statute allows, transporting outside the state (as state schemes need to leave room for Congress to regulate interstate commerce), etc., you can still be prosecuted. But if you're in strict compliance with your state laws and the Feds try to bring charges, you can file for an injunction against them.

Case law suggests that it would be basically impossible for any state to ban something the federal government considers a medicine, and at that point it is up to the discretion of doctors, not politicians to set the criteria for its use for each patient. Therefore, it wouldn't really be banned at all.

174279,0,"Local PerspectiveMany Maryland watermen deny the crab crisis is Trump’s fault. Except it is. Empty bushel baskets at Russell Hall Seafood in Fishing Creek, Md. The company didn’t get any seasonal worker visas to bring crab pickers from Mexico. (Petula Dvorak/The Washington Post)By Petula Dvorak Columnist May 7 at 3:19 PM Email the authorHOOPERS ISLAND, Md. — There’s something new that has reached this desolate, weathered chain of Chesapeake Bay islands, and it’s starting to choke the watermen’s way of life.It’s fear.And that fear is endangering the centuries-old ecosystem around the crab business on these islands.Nearly half of the Eastern Shore’s crab houses have lost the temporary workers, mostly from Mexico, who come every season to pick crabs, the Baltimore Sun reported last week. The businesses couldn’t get visas for the crab pickers because the Trump administration awarded them by lottery this year, instead of on a first-come, first-serve basis.Just one month into crabbing season, everyone here is feeling it. The guy who builds the crab pots, the bait fishermen, the crabbers, the crab house suppliers, the little roadside crab shack, the local general store, the waterman’s wife who can’t afford to stay home with the kids anymore — all of them are in trouble thanks to the fear of immigrants that helped elect President Trump and is now shaping the administration’s hard-line approach toward legal and illegal immigration. A boarded up home on the Chesapeake Bay on Hoopers Island. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)For the most part, though, the very folks in trouble on the Eastern Shore refuse to see the connection.“There are different sides to it.”“Finger-pointing won’t help.”“Immigration has to be legal.”“He’s the best president we’ve had in a long time.”Those are all things that residents of this enclave said when I asked them about the anti-immigration policies damaging their livelihoods.Here’s the problem. The administration isn’t taking aim at just undocumented immigrants. The knee-jerk, simplistic, shut-it-down, build-that-wall approach to the complex issue of immigration is also affecting workers who have been legally coming to the United States and are an integral part of our economy.Harry Phillips, owner of Russell Hall Seafood, understands that. Like his neighbors, he voted for Trump and supports him. But he believes the president has been misinformed on the seasonal H-2B worker visas and would see the devastating results in one quick visit to the island.“We’re 15 minutes away from Washington by helicopter,” said Phillips, whose crab house was quiet Sunday morning, with empty bushel baskets stacked high because the crab pickers aren’t coming. “There’s a landing pad for the helicopter, and we would welcome him here. If the president could just come and see what’s happening to American workers, he could see it right here, the effects of all this.”Phillips is frustrated that his neighbors don’t see the connection as clearly as he does.“People are disappointed,” he said. “They don’t want to blame him. But he’s the man, the man in charge, and I think they just don’t understand.”[About 40 percent of Maryland’s crab houses don’t have pickers this season]The frenetic and unthinking clampdown on the seasonal visas has been disastrous for Maryland’s fragile and beloved blue crab industry. These temporary workers were the key to survival for the crabbing industry in the lower Chesapeake region.Higher up on the bay are the fat No. 1 crabs, the blue big boys you get steamed and then bash with wooden hammers at crab feasts and at waterfront restaurants.That part of the crab industry is doing fine, thank you.But lower on the bay, where herons hang out alongside the roads and crabbers have pots piled high on their front yards, the catch is smaller crabs and females. These are the beauties used in those famous Maryland crab cakes.And for decades, Mexican workers have kept the industry here afloat by doing the picking.“We depend on the Hispanics,” explained Phillips, who has been bringing Mexican workers to Dorchester County since 1992. “They’re the ones keeping us in business. No American people are going to do this job. We’ve tried.”The industry is choking without its temporary workforce.“We’ve never seen it like this,” said Denise Lewis, 44, from behind the counter at Hoopers Island General Store. “For 25 years, I’ve been a waterman’s wife. And this paid for our home. Our cars. Our kids. But he’s not selling bait. And I had to find work.”Her husband is a pound-netter. He’s the one who catches bait fish to sell to crabbers. But crabbers aren’t buying, so he’s not selling.Lewis found a job at the local general store. But that place is also hard-pressed to give her the hours she needs. Business has dropped because the watermen stopped coming in for sandwiches, slices of hummingbird cake, the odd wrench or crabbing boots.Drive down the long, thin island, and you’re surrounded on both sides by water and crabbing. Marinas, boats, stacks of crab pots, woodcuts of blue crabs on mailboxes and front porches.The guy who makes and sells crab pots is also hurting. Bill Meredith, 58, was loading up a truckload of used pots he bought this weekend because the crab pot guy was selling them at a deep discount.“It’s a risk. Because I don’t know how many crabs I’m going to be able to sell,” said Meredith, who lives in Salisbury and crabs closer to Ocean City. “But I’m just going to go ahead and keep crabbing. Hoping for the best. If you cut the pickers, you cut the business. But we’re hoping some pickers come.”[Maryland hoping for more worker visas, but it’s still a gamble]Why does he think this is happening?“Politics,” he said.But he doesn’t blame Trump. Meredith voted for him, along with most residents of Dorchester County.“He’s the only one looking out for the small guy,” Meredith said.So who does he think is responsible for the crab picker crisis?“Oh, that’s all the environmentalists,” he said. “This is how they want it. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation did all of this. They want us to stop crabbing.”I checked in with the foundation, which lobbies for the health and restoration of America’s largest estuary.“We are all about reducing pollution and restoring water quality,” said the foundation’s spokesman, John Surrick. “We have done no work on immigration or the H-2B visa status.”So I asked Lewis, the friendly waterman’s wife who works in the general store. She doesn’t think Trump is to blame, either.“Finger-pointing isn’t going to help,” she said. “It’s really all of them in Washington on the immigration issue.”Rep. Andy Harris (R- Md.) said the administration has agreed to approve 15,000 more visas this week. But Phillips said those will be lottery-based again.“I”m not a gambler. But now my business is based on a gamble,” Phillips said, sitting in his office at sunrise, out of habit. The dock outside his plant is empty. His trucks are lined up in the parking lot, idle. The blue herons aren’t spooked in the quiet. They just look back at Phillips and his empty building.Twitter: @petulad

Bad relationship with Coach and Locker room- Miami needs to clear up cap space with all of their current high earners (Tyler Johnson, Dion Waiters, James Johnson, etc., etc.)=> Carmelo Anthony deal expires after next season, so clears cap space for next season's free agenct (will need to re-sign Winslow)*Plus**If*—big if…— they can get Melo locked in and focused, and accepting of a role within the offense, he can be a useful scoring option for them.##Washington**Current Bad Big Situation** * Wall + Wizards unhappy with current big men * Both have pretty bad contracts, especially Mahinmi * Wall and Gortat bad relationship * Need a better defensive presence in the paint=> Gamble on WhitesideWhile a similar plater to Gortat, if (another if…) Wizards can get him locked in, he would be a great presence on the boards and in the paint, and the stating big man they are looking for*Plus*The picks and Cash Considerations sweeten the pot, and could potentially be used to flip Gortat for another asset.##OKC**Current Bad Melo Situation**- The Thunder were far better with Anthony off the court this regular and postseason- He has a huge salary- potentially bad locker room presence- Unhappy with his role, unwilling to accept bench role- Seems to blame everyone but himself (maybe a little harsh)=> Receive MorrisA decent starting piece who can plug in at the 4, or small ball 5, can score and defend fairly well (would be a very good piece to receive, considering what they are giving up)=> Receive MahinmiFills a need as backup center or could stretch contract to provide a bit more cap space# Why do they say no?##MiamiThis seems to be a good trade for them, but they could say no if:- They think they can make it work with Whiteside- Melo is deemed to be too bad of a presence in their team or will take away shots from their young guys##WashingtonThey are most likely to say no of all the teams, if:- They feel that Whiteside is not the sort of big man they want, and that they are giving up too much for what is a *big* gamble- Would rather play it safe than gamble on mixing it up- Want to keep most of their starting core together, and not give up Morris- Whiteside will make their locker room even worse, and they want a player who gives guaranteed effort every nightBut: They have a terrible GM, so likely they don't think too much about this stuff##OKCIf:- They feel they are better off just sticking it out for another year with Melo, who knows they could make it work (?), and they may prefer to accept this year as one they are not challenging and then have more cap space next year, (if they get Mahinmi, his contact is two years)- They think they are giving up too much for what they getback (Once Melo starts posting Hoodie workout vids)

266106,*,"> I've worked with way too many junior admins who get their feelings hurt when they're asked to research numerous options (usually a run of three), explain and defend each as opposed to just trusting ""best practice"".If this is a pot-shot at my flair, I had a kind of unique role and it's the closest fit (I worked for an MSP, primarily in a consulting position.) Based on my experience there, I would say that in the context of MSP work, >If they don't understand the ""facts"" then either you don't understand the big picture or you haven't done your job in educating them in the proposal process.is almost never the case -- the reason they contracted an MSP in the first place is to avoid doing exactly this! It seems like what happens really frequently in management of clients I worked with is that people would fight change, but also fight being explained options -- most frequently in sectors with government regulations (healthcare, financial). For MSP workers, it's not a matter of your environment, it's a matter of your clientele, and it's a poor choice to turn away money.

290198,0,"I'm not sure why you're so angry. I've already said I'm not a radical feminist, and so I know I don't fit in here. That's why I usually just lurk.I don't really know anything about the history of radical feminism, which is why I straight up asked ""is being gender critical a necessary part of radical feminism"" at the start of this string -- and still no one has answered me. I didn't know what ""gender critical"" was or meant until I came to this subreddit and found a bunch of people who were talking sanity and saying so many of the things that I knew/felt to be true. That's why I stuck around, even though the rad fem bits can be a bit much for me at times.Who gives a shit where else I post? I'm not talking about T_D or anything right wing here, am I? You're the one that brought it up. I'm here to talk about things like female erasure, science and biologic literacy, and SANITY ffs. There's really not anywhere else on reddit that talks about this stuff and the whole reason I'm making a fuss is that if this sub is going to eschew focusing on gender critical posts in favor of radical feminism, which I don't particularly care about, where else am I going to find sane people to listen to?My personal politics don't have anything to do with this conversation, but you became blinded with hatred the second you discovered I was a deplorable Trump supporter. So much for feminism... you have no trouble silencing other women if they don't agree with you politically -- not for saying anything political mind you, just for thinking differently and being in a different tribe. Nevermind that I haven't said a single political thing in this subreddit, even to defend against the claims you made in your last sentence (that's not why I'm here). You're just as bad as a man -- my opinion doesn't matter, and I should just shut up and go away because you know better. Some feminist you are.Maybe it makes you feel better to call me a troll and try to dismiss my feelings and my arguments because you don't agree with me politically, but that really just makes you a hypocrite. The fact is that calling this sub ""gender critical"" if it's not going to focus on gender critical posts is disingenuous. Pointing out joke subs like /r/superbowl, or subs with a history behind their unusual names like /r/marijuanaenthusiasts/ doesn't change that fact. This sub is no different than /r/TwoXChromosomes in that regard.All I want is for a sub called /r/gendercritical to continue to host gender critical content. There are other places I could go for radical feminist crap, if I cared to read or learn about it. There's no where else for GC.

344875,0,"Funny story (that no one will see), my husband and I met at Chili’s. He was a server and I was a hostess. I gave him awful tables because he was always coming in late with bloodshot eyes, even after I saw his truck pull up. I was so naïve at the time, that I didn’t understand the side effects of smoking pot. Anyway, about 2 months later, I saw him getting dishes out of the back and his awesome biceps and half sleeve tattoo (you couldn’t even get tattoos legally in my state at this point), and I remember thinking, “my parents would hate this guy, but damn he’s hot”. Apparently he thought I looked sweet and innocent and liked my, um, figure (my derrière is large, and at the time I met him, I was working out constantly to make it smaller). Our first dates consisted of drinking after work...Presidentes were the best, especially with a shot of Chambord on the side! Long story short(er), we went on a couple of dates and fell in love *way* too quickly, and now, 14-15 years later, we still love to go in to Chili’s occasionally and order our old faves, tip the servers well, and reminisce over the original story. It’s not gourmet food, but man, we love that place.

507703,0,"My mom did that, too, but would never destroy the phone. I always just handed it to her without arguing, and then started deleting my important/secretive conversations right after they happened just in case she unlocked my phone when I was asleep. Eventually I got so upset at being punished because “omg this blog you follow posts photos of weed does that mean you’re a druggie? oh this one posts porn so you’re sexually active??? you’re grounded” that I literally started smoking weed and having sex because why not enjoy myself if I’m going to be punished for it anyway. She’s a good mom. She’s much more chill with my brother now, and to be fair, I _was_ a piece of shit to everyone in high school. But still, this kind of parenting sucks.

529464,0,"You can do it! Fellow high-achieving female in her 30s here. I got a PhD while being a daily smoker. I say that because I used to think I didn't count as a stoner as long as I was high-functioning. But it made everything worse, and harder, and no matter what I was telling myself, I was doing it because I was a person vulnerable to addiction - that's it. I stopped just before I turned 30, after smoking for my entire 20s. I was in love with weed, it was my light in the dark and got me through some real shit. It made sex better, it made any and all food amazing, some of the happiest moments of my life were spent high. But I still wish I'd never started.&#x200B;By the time I stopped, I was smoking maybe 8 joints a day. I started getting panic attacks, went blind a couple times, memory was shot to shit. Lost a relationship that I had become extremely codependent in at that time, so it totally traumatised me. I was under a lot of strain looking after a disabled relative and trying to save my fucked up family, again because I'm codependent (which I was only able to even see recently). Weed was the only idea I had to cope with anything, and it didn't do shit but make things worse. It had stopped feeling euphoric, like the cure-all it used to feel like. Instead I felt either numb, or like I was in a nightmare. I've recently learned that transition from feeling good to feeling nothing/like shit is because weed blunts your dopaminergic system, and that damage persists after you quit. So it literally stops you ever being able to feel good, on it or not, the longer you take it. So I am glad I at least stopped, and I'm hoping my brain recovers more with time. I feel btter than I did. Clearer, calmer, memory is better, I'm better at work. Able to actually work on improving myself, gaining emotional regulation tools.&#x200B;Wanting to stop is the BEST predictor of recovery from any addiction! So you sound very ready and if you just push through that first couple weeks you can start this whole other journey. The perspective you get looking back over your life on weed just isn't possible without kicking it - I am still learning about myself two years later. Shit I wouldn't have been able to see or address otherwise. It's huge. Best of luck, this subreddit is awesome - posting here really helps
