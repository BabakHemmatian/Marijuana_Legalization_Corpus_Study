2619,1,"I didn't wait in line because I went to a low-profile dispensary who only told ""patients"" that it would be open on 1/1 for Adult use. I did see huge lines at dispensaries that advertised. Some places are still liquidating their now-illegal edibles if you just ask rather than looking at the displays. Technically, no more free sampling or consumption on-site yet, but the spots I checked out were skirting the rules in celebration. Prices have gone insane, which was to be expected. A pack of THC Mints and a single gram of top shelf ran me 48 after the new taxes. My buddy picked up some edibles, some kief, and a gram of top shelf - $70. A guy who drove from Stockton to celebrate behind me - 21 dollars for a gram of shake. What really hurts is seeing old prices on display on stock but paying new prices...I'm not happy about the new edible rules, but whatever. I'd rather nobody be in jail. Korova Black Bars are fun and all, but... nobody should be going to jail for a flower, that's more fun in my book. I drove by a busy dispensary and they had a line out the door and around the building. They also posted billboards all over the East Bay...I'm excited for cannabis lounges. I'm also excited for the stupid theater of ""medicinal"" to go away so those who actually need access for therapeutic purposes can get better service. I'm a bit miffed at some of the new regulations, but overall... I went to a dispensary with some friends yesterday and we consumed legally-purchased recreational cannabis. That's incredible.

Lee’s office in drafting the language of HR 4779, which “protects individuals in states that have laws which permit the use of cannabis” for either medical or recreational purposes. Specifically, HR 4779 bars federal funding for any efforts that seek to “detain, prosecute, sentence, or initiate civil proceedings against an individual, business or property that is involved in the cultivation, distribution, possession, dispensation, or the use of cannabis in accordance with the law or regulation of the state or unit of local government in which the individual is located.”Fuck yes, I want to email this woman a virtual kiss.

28422,1,"It's kind of a catch 22, but the violence you described is a major reason why people are against marijuana. When people think of weed, they think of that violence and they are inextricably tied together. Weed=bad.It's more like prohibition + people willing to break the law=bad. But if you don't think about it too much it seems like weed is the root of the problem.
"
45961,1,"Well, we can agree to disagree on which direction the overton window has shifted. I think on some issues, like gay rights and marijuana, it's stifted to the left, on some issues, like corporate personhood and Union support, it's shifted to the right. I don't know enough about the particulars of the Zarete case (I'm just assuming that's the one you're referring to) to comment on it, but I will say that overall, I do back amnesty for the 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. I don't support it because I think these people did right and/or should be applauded. I support it because the consequences of deporting 11 million people are extremely high (and imo not talked about enough by either the right or the left) and will almost certainly create a humanitarian disaster no matter how 'nicely' it's done. Ronald Reagan granted amnesty in the 80's, fairly uncontroversially, so I'm not sure the overton window on this issue was as far right in the past as you think it was. That being said, unlike Reagan, I favor a policy to ensure that we never have to grant amnesty again. As a lefty, I prefer upping e-verify and upping penalties for employing any new illegal immigrants after amnesty, putting the onus on employers to lower the demand for illegal laborers, but I also agree with increasing support for border security -- guards, drones, cameras, motion detectors, etc. If the right needs a wall to feel safe (though I don't know how you wall up the Rio Grande) I'd even compromise on that. What I don't support is the idea that I believe the establishment on both the left and right support, making illegal immigrants a permanent American underclass. Yes, there are stupid people on the left who say bad things about white people, even saying things like that they don't need white people, or that they shouldn't be allowed to vote. Yet, [I live in a state] (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/opinion/north-carolinas-voting-restrictions-struck-down-as-racist.html) where the GOP specifically outlined and implemented ways to restrict voting that were intended to affect black people hardest. From my perspective, the left says shit, the right do shit. So while I spend, imo, more energy and effort than I think is necessary challenging the left to come back to New Deal economic policies to help the working class and stop alienating so many people with negative identity politics, I am still a far, far way from joining the right.

58785,1,"Moved to a legal state a year ago. So far, this is what I've noticed...-Most important, access to CBD and CBD mixes. I really think this was the missing ingredient for me. It reacts SO well with THC and my mind/body. I almost never smoke anything without a little CBD in it. My current go-to strain is a 60/40 THC/CBD sativa strain. I pick up an ounce of it organically grown for $150 every month.-I smoke a lot more concentrate now. It's cheaper and my lungs feel better smoking that vs flower all the time.-There a 1000s of strains to choose from. IME, you find a favorite shop instead of a favorite strain. Prices, location and how well your interaction was with the staff will influence your decision on what to buy more so than the actual strain. Each store has its own niche market. Some are fancy boutique shops with super expensive bud, some are wholesale with limited advertising but bulk deal packages, some are self serve and some you get personalized attention from a budtender.-Coupons. Coupons are huge and since i'm still on a tight budget, I'll pick up the local free magazine that has 20 pages of so of coupons on the back anything from deals on flower, live resin, rosin, wax/shatter, thc diamonds, glass, edibles... whatever. They change weekly and get you to check out new stores.I smoke about the same quantity but obviously the prices are a lot lower. I spend about 1/3rd of what I used to.I wasn't supporting gangs before as most of the stuff available in the illegal state was brought over by hippies from either CO/WA/CA/OR but its SO nice not having to worry about being arrested for it. It's the only place where I've felt like cops aren't out to ""get you"" and have more important stuff to focus on. MY anxiety level has dropped tremendously.

60913,1,"So thank you for your response, but i do have a question. Let's say this WASN'T a state where marijuana has been decriminalized for less than [1.5g](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-marijuana-laws.html). Is it the NRA's position that it's OK for a police officer to kill someone for having a ""wide set nose"" and SMELLING like marijuana?
"
70781,1,"Liberal states take full advantage of state's rights too. Look at California, Washington, Colorado legalizing pot, or Massachusetts (2004), and Maine and Maryland legalizing same sex marriage in 2012. Different states have different interpretations of the 2nd amendment as well- and of course, we know about the differing views on immigration enforcement, even if states have so far refrained from passing actual laws in defiance of federal regulations. Those movements were/are pivotal in driving change on the federal level- if enough states buck the federal law and fight for something, eventually the country follows suit.Edit: I think you are mainly right about the solid states, although the demographics do change with time, and the right candidate can swing a ""solid"" state. Most likely not Texas or California, but Michigan was blue for 20 years before swinging republican this last election. I would vote in a federal election just to remind them that you're there (and to try to get candidates to actually come to your state...); besides, if you're there placing your local and state level votes, might as well get in the federal vote too.

75190,1,"@Clinton passed a bill that banned certain firearms and there was no evidence he violated the constitution. So, stop thinking your first bullet point holds any fucking water. You come across rather ignorant based on that point alone. So, I briefly read through your other points for I see know valuing arguing with someone who claims he is r/iamverysmart and doesn’t understand shit.@Treat firearms as a public health crisis like marijuana. Since they arguably and statistically serve no civilian purpose other than for recreation like drugs. Most mass shootings are stopped by police. Most robberies are stopped by police. Almost all crime is stopped by police. So, this whole bad guy with a gun vs a good guy with a gun bullshit is weak argument.@FBI would need probable cause to enter into someone’s house unless the Constitution was suspended. The people would have time to get rid of their firearms after the ban. If someone is suspected of still having one, FBI comes in. It’s that simple. @This country will change and an amendment will get ratified to overturn the second amendment in time when gun killings become so routine that they have to train teachers to shoot school shooters, most likely hitting other people in the process.

78836,1,"Well the reason that huge amount of land is important is because its the majority of our agricultural production for domestic consumption. If even a few of those states went on a collective strike you would have extreme price hikes and shortages of basic necessities like wheat/flour, corn, and potatoes. (Beef/Pork as well)About disenfranchisement, this is where one of the key policies of America comes in handy. State Rights. See even if the federal government decides something, states can choose to ignore/not enforce it. A ton of liberal states are doing that for weed and California is doing it for illegal immigration. So even if your guy isn't in power, your state will still represent your interests.People are being extremely agitated from this election cycle but its only because of overexposure of outrage culture that makes them more and more irate.

110342,1,"> Interesting that you're growing the drugs rather than just buying some and reselling them in this game.That was my basic idea, and to buy aeratos and/or humidifier ( to make your plants grow faster) at the beginning you *need* to do it, and/or you strech drugs (less quality but same earning).

But a higher popularity also incrases your police manhunt rating.> Will you be able to hire people to do all the distribution for you? Are there multiple locations to sell your stuff? High schools or college campuses for example?hiring people function is something I am aiming for, so yes, finally you can. But I am thinking about an adequate way to implement that, such as: does it decrase your manhunt rating and incrases your popularity or reversa or both - I have to test that. And other things such as, are they able to betray you and if yes - why? Perhaps by incrasing their pay after time or something.The drug selling places for now are the sewers, it‘s a place where police can‘t arrest you. That‘s just because I am not sure for now *how it will happen*. I have an idea, but I am still working on it. Maybe there are some places out of the sewers to sell stuff. It is also possible to do drugs by yourself, anywhere, and yes they can (de)buff your stats. It‘s necessary if you want to find out the wuality, if you didn‘t cook by yourself. There are places you can do drugs without getting arrestet, just to trip (or getting the buffs). That‘s what I am aiming for. However, if you do drugs in town your manhunt rating incrases.> Will I be able to get people addicted to drugs and then pimp them out?That also was one of my first ideas, and it‘s something I am working on, such as an intelligent way to implement that function. It will probably incrase your popularity, but also your manhunt level.Edit: you can check your manhunt level by watching news on tv amongst other things or your computer, if you bought one of those. There are much more other things you can do with them.

133880,1,"I'm expecting a big bump after legalization due to hype. Then it will get rocky. We will see who is truly able to execute and profit. Who is truly in demand. Who gets bought and who goes bankrupt. Quality products should be able to demand higher price and make a nice margin, shittier products will either fail, or become the ""Bud Light"" of pot (shitty but cheap and consistent and available) if they can own their shittiness but pump out a lot of consistent product at a low price.Legalization is priced in, but so is risk. We don't currently have a good idea of how it will all play out. Not every stock is going to the moon. Do your DD and pick the ones you think can survive.

140005,1,"Your question is not far fetched. Money handlers have already begun the purging of firearm owners abilities to use various forms of payment for firearm related purchases. Paypal for example restricts use for firearms, Citibank has announced restrictions for firearm related businesses and this Rabobank decision in this post. These banks are dipping their toes in the water and soon other's will join them. This tactic is used to suppress the marijuana business in some states where is has been legalized siince the feds are still against the legalization of it. The feds warn banks not to do business with the pot dealers and many banks oblige. Not the same scenario but I could envision a day under different leadership in DC, where semi-auto weapons were banned and ""Free"" states finally told DC to pound sand. The government would have the power to enforce laws on FFL dealers who violated the fed laws and they could lean on banks who were doing business with the rebel FFL's.

All I'm talking about is how the Right uses the cries of State Rights! in order to maintain States in an abusive relationship with their citizens. In order to disrupt that check and balance system I described. 1st it was regarding Jim-Crow laws, separate but equal... all that abusive crap. Now it's mostly about allowing companies to abuse their citizens within state borders. Cigarette companies, environmental polluters.... Now it's used as a term because it works for a whole host of whatever it is the Republican party currently is pushing.

168280,1,">do you seriously think that making cannabis illegal makes people try meth instead?Yes, I think there's a good chance it is a big contributing factor.The logic I've often heard/read is that police removing the supply of illegal cannabis means people turn to what is available (meth), and also gangs controlling access to cannabis means they can supply and get people onto meth when they otherwise wouldn't.If these users could just go down the road and buy some joints easily and legally, I imagine a big proportion of these would just go and do that and would never mess with harder drugs.In terms of 'the war on drugs', Police have been working hard the last few years from what I've heard on cracking down on weed growers, often heard how dry NZ is etc. And it's no secret that gangs run a lot of illegal substances in NZ, especially in smaller towns.My experiences are purely anecdotal, but the logic isn't ridiculous.

For example, someone gets pulled over and is suspected of driving drunk, a cop can administer a breathalyser test. There's not exactly an equivalent way to test if someone is high. It wouldn't be fair to arrest someone for driving under the influence because they test positive for weed even if they haven't smoked or anything in weeks.

Now there are some multi-layer pouches that I've seen some edibles come in (didn't buy them) but there are also single-use steamable rice pouches that are non-recyclable and those are sold in bulk at every grocery store (And consumed much more often).Not only that, you've got the #StonerCleanupInitiative borne out of the idea that we have to separate the socially-imposed belief that stoners are lazy ingrates that dump snack trash everywhere in parks. IMO (not a ""Denver native"") I pretty much exclusively see teenagers publicly dumping trash but, I wouldn't blanket them with the idea that all teenagers are litterers (Though I might be crazy enough to assume that most litterers are teenagers).TL;DR all the plastic containers I've ever purchased cannabis in have had recycling symbols, they were primarily #5 just like my prescription pill bottles. So the trash was there long before legalization.

With this being said however I could see there being downsides in a few situations - if you experience paranoia from cannabis (and a higher CBD strain doesn't help) this could make symptoms worse. Personally I've only found this an issue on a couple of occasions but I live in the UK where it's illegal so you never quite know what you're getting. The biggest problem I've found though is simply munchies. Taking all my symptoms away is great until I eat a whole packet of cookies, a waffle and slam an Oreo milkshake 😂All in all though I'd recommend trying it, particularly a high CBD strain.

Sure, we could blame politics on the whole issue with corporate greed, but honestly it's how the system is supposed to work. Most people outside of those major cities only see marijuana as a criminal plant, outlawed because the only people who bring it in are the cartels who are down to do some pretty messed up stuff to make some cash. Obviously times have drastically changed, but what parents teach their children do not, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out a lot of these people who hold this ideology have had either direct or indirect dealings with cartels at some point in their life. Hell, if I was growing up and kept hearing about how the cartels would murder people just South of the border constantly and then know they're the biggest importer of marijuana, I'd (albeit naively) keep the ideal that we need to ensure it stays illegal so it's not something the cartels can legitimize for more money. Yes, obviously with our knowledge available to us now because it's been legalized elsewhere and proven to assist in some ways (because we can't actually prove it's fixed a lot of issues directly just yet), but most of these people are going to hold on to their values and ideology because it's a very ""us versus those Godless heathens"" mindset. I'm sure there's plenty of influential people (both religious and political) who push fears into these people regarding marijuana and how it'll destroy everything God build, etc. etc.&#x200B;So because of all that, those people who get voted into office (the majority) all have this fear already put into them about marijuana to the point they don't want to even mention it.

Being able to accurately track data will, ideally, allow the government to show that legalizing weed has not caused a huge spike in it's use, which is what the Conservatives are constantly screaming about. It can also provide insight into consumption rates in different regions, juxtaposed with those region's approaches (private retail, public retail, mixed, no home grow, home grow, etc). For example, if the government can show that use has not increased in provinces that have no banned home growing, then it could justify lifting those bans in provinces like Quebec or Manitoba. tl:dr: More accurate data is always helpful.

I don't think It's the sort of service a government should be providing via Taxation, nor should it be pestering door to door and issuing search warrants for civilian's houses to investigate whether or not you have the ability to play live TV, since in 2018, every house has numerous ways of playing the BBC, because It's not a secure/restricted Network and every modern TV/Phone/Tablet/Computer/Console has the ability to play the BBC in some capacity whether the individual plans to use it or not.If it's going to be done, in my eyes, it needs to be changed drastically, I don't have the data so I can't give you a solution, all I know is I don't want people being pestered by government backed forces about not paying for a TV service they have pretty much no choice in having access to. So, with many heaps of salt and no numbers or serious analysis to back it up, here goes:I'd split the programming that provides Societal Benefits, Whether that be Documentaries/News/Politics/Kids TV, from the rest of it. Collaborate with foreign Markets to dish out the entertainment (and probably news too) portion of the Network abroad, also sell to 3rd party broadcasters like they currently do with Netflix for example. These sales can be paired along with a UK Opt-in Subscription (Rather like a Netflix Account or a Sky/BT Subscription) for the regular ""Entertainment"" programming, Sports/Top Gear/Bargain Hunt/Peaky Blinders/Eastenders etc, that way the only people paying for this stuff are those that want it and if it's not profitable, It won't get made, as it shouldn't. You could maybe consider as an extra funding method dropping in Government Ads (NHS, Armed Forces, Taxes, Emergency services etc) which will still keep the Independence from the Private Sector Advertisers and would also sprinkle in useful information for UK Citizens while pulling cash from Areas of Government.The above Entertainment products better be producing money, If they aren't, this bit won't work (and if they don't, it's because they aren't watched, in which case we can cut them now and lower the Licence fee). Here is the Important side, the bit we actually do get something from, News/Politics/Kids TV/Documentaries. It would be produced and accessible to all UK Citizens using the proceeds of the Entertainment Business.Now, as you said, the Licence fee does contribute to National Infrastructure so how about we move that into the sharing pot with Legitimate Taxation and it can be picked up from there, like Sewers/Roads/Homes and all other infrastructure areas, no need to have it separate, It can be weighed against the other important parts of our Infrastructure and If it needs money, It will get it.That's pretty much all I got, I think it sounds reasonable for 1a.m on a School Night by a random Redditor. I ultimately don't bloody know, what I do know is I dislike how it is currently done. Goodnight!

Not sure how long the SC is to the destination, sometimes the payout is augmented for this reason.Some complaints I do have with the current system:* when I'm not planning to wing up now I have to weed through a large number of wing missions that I would never pick up.* not great variety in size -- it seems the majority would be no fun at all to do in anything smaller than a Type 9. Shouldn't there be wing cargo missions scaled for Type 6's and 7's, Clippers, Pythons or even Type 10 or Anaconda?* the payout/effort doesn't scale for different wing sizes. A mission might be OK for a wing of 4 or even 3 but be quite unattractive for a wing of 2.* The reward is equal for all wing members, regardless of how much they hauled.Payout size aside, I think the reward should be split (rather than duplicated) across the wing according to amount hauled, with somewhat generous time bonuses (possibly linear degradation rather than all-or-none) calibrated to encourage faster completion, rewarding larger ships and larger wing in this way. A system like this (and a wider spread of tonnage) could permit the mission to still work effectively with 1-2 players in larger ships or 3-4 players in smaller ships. Maybe all cargo missions should work this way -- e.g. you could have a CMDR in a Type 6 committing to bring 260T of cargo in ~3 trips (or a wing could do it in 1 trip), while a T7 or Python could do it in one.

It is NOT my intention to offend anyone or any religion... I'm just confused and trying to find a path.Alhamdulillah(All praises due to Allah) we are happy that you are asking these questions.--->I was created in a non-practicing Catholic house, so my basis on religion were always very weak. As a teenager I was an atheist, but I would say I was just under influence of others and trying to be edgy: I didn't know anything about religion or philosophy to take a side. Today, I define myself as an agnostic theist.That is good because those that are atheist deny any possibility of the existence of our Creator as if they know the absolute reality. An agnostic at least says they don't know or they are agnostic theists and believe in Allah but they reject certain religions.--->Truth is I'm still very confused with all this and, together with my OCD, this is kinda disturbing me in the way I live my life... my confusion is seriously influencing my decisions.This is a sign of Allah. Man is created with a fitrah (natural predispositions). Of this is the desire to worship our Creator alone with no partners or anything in between. As I understand it you believe in Allah but your are confused as to how to praise Him.>Which criteria were the strongest ones to you to have the beliefs you have today?I would invite you to study Islam and accept it but only after you are convinced. Don't accept Islam just because, accept it because you are truly convinced that this is the religion that Allah wants you to>I don't know what religion to believe from the plenty we are shown. I like to think that the most ancient scripture is the one closer to the truth, but I'm afraid I can't go with a criteria simple as that.As Muslims our position is that Allah had send many Prophets and Messengers with the true religion. Some of them may be familiar to you as an ex-Catholic such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus whom we believe preached the religion of Allah. However over time the followers of these religions had corrupted their religions which is why there are many prophets. Their job is to refresh mankind with the correct method to praise Allah. We believe that Muhammad is the last and final Prophet that Allah has sent however this time Allah has willed to protect Islam from corruption. Allah sent all the Prophets and Messengers with the same basic fundamental teachings. They may have spoken different languages and lived in different periods of time however they all preached the same fundamental message which is tawheed (uncompromising monotheism).This is wikipedia which is not a scholarly or academic source but it is good enough to get a quick understanding of tawheed:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawhid--->Also, I do believe that there is something beyond. I do believe that conciousness is too incredible to be just a coincidence... I even considered pantheism because of the power of conciousness and that maybe we are the gods, but then I think in what created this or the rule system of this world and I go more biased to a God.Alhamdulillah this ties in with what was mentioned earlier about the fitrah. The concept of pantheism is against the concept of tawhid so as Muslims we reject this. The Creator is not like the Creation.>*""And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.""* http://legacy.quran.com/112/4--->Another thing: some strange and too unlikely synchronicities that happened with me made me believe that there is even more of something beyond, it actually made me give more attention to law of attraction, chaos magick and some other things in the occult.As Muslims we reject the concept of randomness. We believe everything is controlled by Allah and that everything in the universe submits to the will of Allah. I'm a engineer we refer to these rules that Allah has placed upon creation as physics.>*The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.* http://legacy.quran.com/17/44Nothing is random and everything is quantifiable and this is also our belief as well:>*He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who has begotten no son (children or offspring) and for Whom there is no partner in the dominion. He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.* http://legacy.quran.com/25/2--->This dilemma is kinda hard, as I said, there are decisions that I take that can change depending on the chosen paradigma. I love doing weed once in a month, but sometimes I wonder if this is a forbidden practice, a sin, and if I will go to hell for 'doing harm for the temple that is my body'. But, in other way, I do think that there were a lot o dogmas created for control a chaotic society. I don't know if I shall only practice bhakti yoga and live my life only praising God, I don't know if is right for me to drink alcohol and smoke tobacco sometimes, and I fear that I will somehow be punished for not believing vigorously in any religion in particular. How do I know that I am living life the right way?Allah created us knowing that we will sin. Some people sin and don't repent some sin and repent. For example Adam sinned but he repented and Allah forgave him. Satan sinned and did not repent so he lost his position and is now the accursed one. So you will commit sin no matter what however what is important is how you react after you sin.>*Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “By Him in whose hand is my soul, if you did not sin Allah would replace you with people who would sin and they would seek the forgiveness of Allah and He would forgive them.”* [Sahih Muslim 2749](https://abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2012/01/16/hadith-on-repentance-if-you-did-not-sin-allah-would-replace-you-with-people-who-would-sin-and-he-would-forgive-them/)--->For now, I know little of some religion or another that I find to be interesting and follow, but try to keep skeptical sometimes with the dogmas to not be kinda baited to something that was created for pure control.We Muslims believe everyone is enslaved to something regardless of religion. We even refer to ourselves as the slaves of Allah. The important thing is to be a slave to The Creator not the creation. People are enslaved to all kinds of things and unless one is a slave of Allah they will at most only get temporary pleasures.--->Today, I have sometimes some personal prayers/non-formal to God and Jesus, but I consider that anything could be right, from the nihilism paradigma to the Abrahamic or Hindu religions... but I'm more biased to the more ancient ones because of the argument I mentioned. I'm also considering reading stuff like Kybalion, but not sure if this can help. Can someone that already were in this position give me some light or hints? I am worried if I'm living right and will not be punished for anything.It is good that you wish to worship the Creator. Allah created us for no reason except to worship Him alone with no partners, no associations or intermediaries.>*And I (Allah) created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me (Alone).* http://legacy.quran.com/51/56As Muslims we believe in Jesus. You can't be a Muslim unless you believe in Jesus. But we believe in him in a way that is befitting of his status. That Jesus is a Prophet and Messenger of Allah and that he is nothing more than a human being. We accept this virgin birth we accept that he is the Messiah. However we reject any divinity that the later Christians had associated with him.>Thank you!Like I said Alhamdullillah that you are asking these types of questions. We encourage you to ask questions and learn about Islam. Since you mentioned you were raised Catholic we recommend you read these two chapters of the Quran. Surah Al-Maihah the name refers to what the Christians call the last supper and Surah Maryam which is about Mary the mother of Jesus.

150966,0,"I believe that the US armed forces would fall apart at such an order, but for arguments sake, lets say they go for it.The main fights at first wouldn't be with the Military, but likely with the police enforcing the laws at first. Officers trying to carry out oppressive laws would start getting shot, and I think those battles could very easily be pretty brutal and even. The first one would likely go to the police, but each battle would bring more people over to the fight. Soon all the battles are losing battles and the police won't be able to do anything, anywhere, and that will likely also include other services like the fire departments. That would lead to the national guard or military getting deployed to keep order. This would not be a standup fight, but would probably look like snipers taking pot shots at patrolling troops. The US does not have enough troops to reinforce every city across the country and if they tried they would fall apart logistically.

161961,0,"Thanks for posting, welcome. Only about 3 weeks in myself, after years of trying to quit, but I totally identify with what you said about getting back at people for how they treated you.As the old saying goes, holding onto anger is like poisoning yourself and expecting the other person to die. Weed addiction is a real manifestation of that impulse. Since it isn’t heroin, it’s very easy to convince our high brains that we don’t have a real problem, that it’s not a real addiction, etc. But it is absolutely a subtle poison that will seem like it treats you well while while robbing you of self esteem and volition, like an abusive relationship. Not a huge shocker that you struggle with this given your past. What helped me was realizing that punishing myself in anger at others will only result in confirming others’ valuation of me. If I REALLY want to get back at them, I should be the best version of myself and ignore their opinions. Sure they’ll try to take credit for your success, but so fucking what! You’re the one who has to live with you, and if they’re pathetic enough to beat you down then take credit for you being a healthy person, let em have it. It’s sad really, and you’ll be healthy enough to not be affected by them one way or another. Get motivated to get strong. It takes a lot of time but you have the natural ability to have power over your circumstances, no chemical aid required. I had to change my mind about wanting to be healthy and to stop hating myself, which honestly reading this sub has helped me to do. Keep engaging with the community and nurture this urge for life like the delicate flame it is. Don’t let the haters see it until it’s a roaring bonfire, then their jealousy will be like like a squirt bottle against it. Practically, cold showers helped me feel like a badass and that I could finally kick weed and porn for good. I recommend starting the practice if you have a hard time acting.

Eu nunca achei que ela poderia ajudar pessoas autistas.E pra piorar ainda mais, o país com mais capacidade de fazer essas pesquisas classifica cannabis como ""droga com alto potencial de abuso e com ZERO APLICACOES MEDICINAIS"" igual a heroína. Se isso não é um crime grave contra a própria natureza eu não sei o que é.

Na época, os policiais localizaram 1.420 quilos da substância em malas. O entorpecente, na ocasião, foi avaliado em R$ 23 milhões. **Tonéis plásticos** A droga, apreendida nesta sexta, era transportada em uma carreta, proveniente de São Paulo, escondida em meio a uma carga de tonéis plásticos. A polícia conseguiu inteceptar a droga durante um bloqueio realizado na BR-407. O motorista do caminhão e outras duas pessoas, que estavam em outro veículo, foram presos em flagrante. Segundo a PF, dois detidos seguiam a carga como “batedores” para garantir a segurança do entorpecente. A identidade dos envolvidos não foi divulgada. Os três suspeitos irão responder pelos crimes de tráfico drogas e associação para o tráfico. Somadas, as penas podem chegar a 25 anos de reclusão. A polícia segue investigando outros possíveis envolvidos no crime. A droga apreendida nesta sexta seria destinada para cidades do nordeste e países da América do Norte e da Europa, segundo a Secretaria de Segurança Pública da Bahia (SSP-BA).
