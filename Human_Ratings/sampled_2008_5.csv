14,1,"I've thought of doing this too... but with the hemp seeds you can buy legally. Those seeds sold in the UK in health food shops like Holland and Barretts are Cannabis sativa ruderalis, which is the stuff grown as hemp and has next to no THC content. Also the seeds sold for food have had their shells removed, so I doubt you could get them to ever actually germinate.Does anyone know where hemp seeds can be obtained that will germinate? It'd be great to sprinkle the seeds about in the plant beds in my local town centre :) There isn't much difference in the look of icky sticky bud plants and industrial hemp, especially to the average joe when the plants are veg'ing :)

"
134,1,"He doesn't have to, for the most part. The feds use financial penalties to get state and local governments to toe the line in the War on Drugs. Over the last few years, several states have tried to implement medical marijuana exemptions as a wedge issue, and even that has been overridden by the Feds. So, while states and local governments do have the power to continue a War on Drugs, the principal actor is the Federal Government.

238,1,"Somewhere in [The War On Drugs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRutaNMZt54&feature=PlayList&p=0F08E8D641597D5F&index=0) they actually show you a legal growers area, but in order to see it they had to have bags on their head and be driven there and back so they couldn't tell the cops where it was. Because, in california, medical marijuana may be legal, but it's still a federal crime to grow it.

268,1,">Why can't you simply tell me why you posted those comments and somehow thought it proved them to be anti-choice?(Since I don't wanna do edits and I wanna get your question split off so we can have separate discussions since you think you're Jermey Paxman)Where did I say this?You said:>Those are not the only two choices. We can vote for a democrat.I responded saying that democrats are no better, but you continue to insist that abortion being left to the states (which I believe will not universally ban it, it will only be banned in [Jesusland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesusland_map)) is more important than genocide in Iraq and soon Iran.So tell me first how Paul, being pro-states-rights is going to ban abortion nationally by instead shifting the power to the states? Of course, you can overlook that he's also interested in ending the drug war and [pardoning anyone convicted of a non-violent drug crime](http://www.usadaily.com/article.cfm?articleID=224961), you can overlook that it's still a federal crime to grow marijuana even for medical marijuana clinics in states where medical marijuana is legal, because the federal government, for all it's flaws of keeping good medicine from those who would die without it, at least lets women get abortions.

433,1,"I actually thought it was good except for that. The war against murder *is* lost. The war against rape is lost. Do you think we'll ever bring an end to all murder? To all rape? They're all lost. But it's not always about winning. Sometimes it's about doing the best you can.The drug war is not a the same fight as these. If (big if) it is a problem, then it's a social and a medical problem, not a legal problem. How can we claim to live in a free country if I can't go see what the big deal is about cocaine? How free are we if I can't grow some pot in my back yard and then smoke it in the privacy of my own home?

752,1,"I don't know of any media blitz, beyondthat had been said for half a centuryabout anything anyone enjoyed by the suffragette crowd. Thealcohol prohibition cops needed somethingto do. Harry Anslinger,who became the head of federal drug enforcement, pretty much invented the M. Stamp Tax Act.Marijuana was the recreational drug of choice in black and chicano culture. It's oftensaid, because unlike alcohol, marijuana doesn't turn you into a dangerous idiot,and prosperous communities can afforddangerous idiots better than marginalizedcommunities. Hence the value of prohibiting marijuanain particular. Marijuana prohibition presently disenfranchises about 2 1/2million minority, probably mostly liberal,votes on account of felony convictionsfor non-violent, victimless crimes.In case you're wondering why a stamp taxact. It's because it required an amendmentto the constitution to outlaw booze & anotherto un-outlaw booze. & people & lawmakers were mostlyembarrassed about that whole episode, asthey rightly should have been. The stamptax act was in lieu of direct prohibitionto avoid addressing the fundamentally embarassing problem that it took a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol,but not to ban marijuana.Now, of course, we don't care diddly aboutthe Constitution, and the federal authoritiessubscribe to the philosophical argument:""bend over and we'll administer your rights"".
"
753,1,"The person they confiscated the bud from may well be in jail, while the cop just gets to resign with no charges.Even in the unlikely event the original owner of the pot escaped jail, thousands are imprisoned for pot-related charges. Losing your job is bad news, but nothing compared to losing your whole life in prison for possessing bits of a plant.
"
790,1,"I've thought about it, but some of the stories I've heard about the legal system lately are really scary. I'd hate to have accidentally walked on a microscopic piece of a marijuana plant and get a nearly undetectable amount on my shoe prior to arriving there.
"
806,1,"Who decides who the criminals are, and what the crimes are? Did you know that in 2006, we arrested more people for marijuana crimes than every violent crime *combined*? And that 90% of those marijuana arrests were just for possession, and not trafficking? 44% of all drug arrests in the United States; FBI, DEA, state police, metro police, county sherrif, etc. Just imagine how much money would be saved by not processing or prosecuting these people, and how more effective we could be at policing drugs that are actually dangerous, both physiologically and culturally.http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=7370And indeed, who decides who's crazy? Not so long ago, electroshock ""therapy"" and lobotomies were considered cutting-edge psychiatric tools.And who decides who gets wiretapped? When a warrant is not required, then *the suspicion of a crime is not required either*.
"
881,1,"I do get your point about injustice delegitimizing the marijuana statutes. My point is not that they're morally right or good policy -- they are neither -- just that they are validly enacted by democratically-elected legislatures. I'd be as happy as you to be rid of them. Thing is, that is best done by leaning on elected representatives, not by impotently declaring that the law shouldn't be recognized on the basis of personal disagreement.
"
1111,1,"Sorry but your point is not valid. Ever been a pot smoker? There is a thing called a Guerilla Garden. Rogue pot patches, are commonly the object of law enforcement raids in ALL parks, from Metro to National, and if you think all those growers are benign stoners (many are,) think again. The largest of these are maintained by drug gangs. Who don't care about posted no gun laws. Metro parks in my city, popular jogging, biking, and general recreation activities, have been recently plagued by a series of rape attempts, and have always been a prime place for muggings, despite regular police patrols on bike and in cruiser. I know something bad could happen if I went running on any given day, and the police might not get there. So I should just not go? It's my park!
"
1132,1,"Same reason alcohol is legal and marijuana isn't.
"
1162,1,"Sounds about right actally, having gone to OU. For those of you who aren't aware, Ohio University has always been a liberal/hippie party school and I loved every second of it. Notice that even if they are charged, they'll likely only get probation unless they've been caught before. Some of my engineering professors openly expressed their desire to have weed legalized. This is the general mentality of the school and therefore finding a small bag of pot is not a big deal, especially compared to the fire damage. If that doesn't make it a great school, then the fact that Richard Dean Anderson went there pretty much seals the deal.
"
1399,1,"You can't legislate curiousity out of the human spirit. As long as there isn't a cultural ritual which evolves around these substances people put into their body for fun... it won't develop into a big deal. Alcohol is sold in pubs, and that becomes a big way to connect with members of the opposite sex. Because of all the cultural context, alcohol becomes very prevalent in our society. I don't think the same thing would happen with marijuana, and certainly not with things like heroin. If it were legal, everyone would do it once, to satisfy their curiousity and then be done with it, and go on with their lives.
"
1448,1,"One more thing that is very important. When you should be mad and fighting for rights is when your ability to experiment is illegal. You should get no special allowances until it is proven, except for the right to experiment. As far as I know, other than lacking the special privileges, it is not illegal to play with new households consisting of same sex parents. It is also not illegal to homeschool, build communes, etc. But as soon as a new idea for how to live is flat out illegal, get in there and fight for rights. Right now adults can do pretty much anything. The illegal stuff involves parenting. Give your son some marijuana in peace pipe ceremony? Probably lose him. Teach him about sex through hands-on experience? Definitely lose him. Are you outraged about that? Maybe not, because it doesn't involve your lifestyle. But if I were a same-sex parent right now I wouldn't be fighting for marriage rights. I'd be fighting against people legally able to step in and take my children. That'll be the first attack. They'll say you're harming them with your lifestyle, are unfit, and haul them off. First one must get rid of all the threats on a lifestyle before they can ask for special allowances. Yours is way far from that.
"
1499,1,"Yeah, but the problem is that there's nothing morally wrong with it in the first place. So he's a businessman! There are plenty of alcohol breweries that operate their businesses in many states, yet for some arbitrary, absurd, stupid reasons, marijuana is illegal and alcohol is not.There is no justification of any sort -- moral, rational, any -- for why marijuana should be illegal but alcohol legal. Cigarettes alone are responsible for more deaths than all other drugs combined, and alcohol is orders of magnitudes more than pot ... which ... has never killed anyone ever as far as we know, and has no real negative effects later on.A devil's advocate position could at least make sense and be **consistent** if it argued that **all** drugs should be illegal, or that drugs should be illegal if they are more harmful than some threshold (which again would not justify any drug to be legal if marijuana is not -- see [harm charts](http://www.gizmag.com/go/7037/picture/32840/) and such studies on these matters). Any position that states marijuana is bad but nicotine and alcohol are OK ... this position is wrong because no reasonable argument can be made, drawing upon all known evidence and data. I am firmly convinced that no abstract principle which prohibits marijuana would not prohibit more alcohol and nicotine (using the same standards).Furthermore, I believe that the Constitution does not give the government the power to regulate what adults can consume in private [1], and that any laws restricting the distribution of consumption of any drugs are inherently immoral.[1] There would be some exceptions, like antibiotics, which I believe are OK to regulate loosely for obvious reasons, and perhaps some other dangerous medicines that we should put barriers in place for. The government should only prevent people from hurting themselves on accident, not on purpose.And before anyone makes an ad hominem reply (which would be [down a level](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html)), as people always seem to do in such debates (""You only think that because you're a stoner""), let me just say that I don't use marijuana or any other illegal drugs.

1575,1,"i propose we don't mark said boundary and let people find out for themselves what is and is not fun for them. just enforce the laws we have already in regards to criminal behavior. drugs don't make people criminals, the scarcity and high price of drugs and the stigma associated with them makes people criminals. if you NEED a drug and you are not thinking right in the head AND you are paranoid because THEY ARE OUT TO GET YOU and you still NEED the drug and the only way you can get it is from that shady character that hangs out on the corner and he wants a rediculous amount of money then you are going to do whatever you can to get the money because your hooked ... now, i'm talking about crack or H here, not pot. Pot people are MUUUUCH more relaxed and prefer to just know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who grows it in their basement. But still, there is this level of fear and oppression that goes along with it that forces people to have to be criminals just to have a good time. Just like the speakeasy's of yesterday. Personally, I blame the children. They are far to easy to manipulate, and far to stupid to understand what is right and what is wrong, and anyone who was ever a kid will tell you that they didn't know anything about anything until they were at least 45 years old. Smart people are only old farts. Kids are dumb and don't know better.

1812,1,"> If you look at the history of our drug laws, you will find that they were borne in large part out of racist hatred; for Chinese, for Mexicans, but most of all, for blacks.Let me point out that drugs, right down to cannabis, are illegal just about everywhere, including ethnically homogenous countries. I don't deny that racism has played a part in shaping your drug laws, especially the long sentences for posession of minor amounts etc. but it's also a part of a larger pattern of being ""tough on crime"", politicans showing decisiveness by appearing to do something dramatic to solve a problem.Racism is by no means a _sufficient_ explanation for drug laws.

Well, one night I went out to pick up the limo for a gig and I seen a county sheriffs car parked in his driveway. I almost kept going but I had slowed down for the turn and the cops would have stopped me anyways. As soon as I did pull in all I seen was cops...everywhere...they were all suited up in their 'Rambo' outfits...shotgun belts..the whole nine yards. A few of them swarmed my truck, making me get out and questioning me..they checked my truck inside and out..looking for hidden compartments...one cop kept fooling with the passenger side airbag and I was waiting for it go off. Anyways, they pulled me into the limo office and questioned the shit out of me..the good cop/bad cop scenario. I was only there to pick up the limo and I had my limo garb on so they couldn't accuse me of being in league with my boss (although I did know a lot about what went on) and they finally let me go. I had to call my people that I was supposed to drive that night because the coppers wouldn't let me take a limo. He ended up going to jail, paid 10k to run a trial and ended up moving away. The cops never did find anything (he wasn't stupid, he never kept his shit at his house), but a roach in an ashtray.

And only mentioned our stuff as normal street weed, which it wasn't.They just pick and choose high figures today and low figures from the 70s and talk about the massive increases from when they used to smoke as kids. The simple truth is that strong weed takes longer to grow, so you are normally getting weak weed 4% unless you are paying extra.They never talk about dangerous glass laced weed on the streets in the UK, drug dealers spraying on small amounts of silicon as the plant is growing to increase the weight.

In much the same way, I support the legalization of marijuana although having smoked it. This doesn't mean that I follow every law. Who does?

I preferred Paul, but I would have been much happier with Kucinich than many of the other candidates. Sure, we disagree on spending and gun rights, but we can fight those battles when we come to them.

4083,1,"A lot of this depends on visibility to *los federales*. Federal law enforcement doesn't have the resources to crack down on every cannabis patient -- or even every dispensary -- in the states where medical cannabis is legal. And moreover, they're almost certainly being directed not to try too hard, to prevent a political backlash.(Keep in mind that the DEA sees opposition to cannabis legalization as part of its ambit -- despite the obvious conflict of interest. The DEA doesn't just want to enforce the law, but also to prevent voters from changing the law. If that's not anti-democratic, I don't know what is.)One positive result of the current medical cannabis situation is that it's taking away the basis for several bad arguments in the conversation about drugs. One of those is ""don't bust the users, bust the dealers"" -- as raids on cannabis dispensaries get press, it's more obvious to more people that in order to use cannabis you generally need someone willing to sell it to you.

Obama wouldn't do that, he encourages people to think of each other equally, so he'll create a great divide between whites and blacks because blacks will declare him no longer black (many already have) as they define separatism as part of their racial identity. But that really doesn't matter. Do I want to live in a place where people are not just tolerant of alternative lifestyles and differeing races but accepting of them and all of that? Of course I do. But that's going to require a lot of old people to die, and nothing whatsoever other than that will bring about real change. The generation I grew up with, I'm 29 BTW, doesn't understand racism. It's a foreign concept. For most people, suggesting they might be racist would be like suggesting they might be in favor of bondushardian absolutism. They can't even conceive of it. Thinking different of someone because of where they stick their penis or what color it is? What kind of backward fuck thought that up? But the old people, oh how they roll with it. Same with dumb ideas like pot being illegal, videogames being banned for mature content, etc. We just have to wait for old people to die for those things to become rational.But it doesn't matter. I can't vote for someone who is probably going to kill over a million innocent people. For me, that's a deal-breaker. it doesn't matter if Obama would go over there, give all million innocent Iranians that die $100k funerals, come back to America, disband the military, declare the USA a neutral territory, restore every civil liberty we've lost, abolish the income tax, disband the CIA and prosecute all CIA employees for the shit they've been involved in, etc, etc, etc. None of that would balance the scales of even a dozen innocent people dying just so Lockheed Martin and Boeing and Halliburton and Bechtel and those companies can get more contracts and we can have significant control in the middle east.

4388,1,"Not really. It doesn't work since it is anecdotal. Just as you would feel my brother having golden hash of all drugs planted on his table by a dirty cop who didn't like the attitude a black kid gave him when the cop showed up on an ""anonymous domestic abuse tip"" at 6 am.My brother had no roommates or girlfriend. No one anyone can think of that would have wanted to do that to him either. All anyone can think is the cop got mad because my brother was tired of talking to him at 6 am on a Sunday after only 30 seconds. He felt it was within his rights to say ""You are mistaken, I have no roommates or girlfriends, and unless you want to arrest me leave cause I want to go back to bed.""He was arrested for resisting arrest, and possession of hash. He hasn't smoked weed even, and I can't think of anyone who has ever seen golden hash.Anecdotal though. Does it mean it is a personal testimony, yeah. It doesn't mean anything beyond that though. Not all police show up at the door and plant hash on you and say you ""resisted arrest"" when you don't lick their boots if they show up by accident.

Probably the kind that steels your stash and smokes it in the cop car.I was at a mall and I took a couple tokes before I went into a bar where they serve legal drugs. (I don't medicate and drink, usually never works out very well) Anyway the pig arrested me and sat me on the curb and kept questioning me about where I was hiding the rest of my pot. The officer said, ""If you don't tell me where it is I'm calling my k-9 crew and I'm gonna tow your truck and strip it till I find it."" I looked at his partner who seemed much cooler and in my head I knew he was talking bullshit. The great thing was I was smoking some REALLY good shit and Officer Bueno asked me if I was ready to reveal where my big stash wasbut I just kept giggling. Because I knew I'd be ok, I mean I'm in California. So the douche nozzle uncuffed me and gave me a ticket. And said have a nice day. Luckily not every person cought with God's plant is a dealer. They took my 2 centimeter roach as evidence. The judge excused me a couple weeks later and well I'm just waiting for the DEA and NSA and IRS to bust my door down for being on Reddit Marijuana.

One could argue no one ""fully reali[ses]"" the consequences of their actions. Moreover, I would argue that murder (defined as unjust killing) is so obviously wrong to the human being that any human that has the capacity to think would fully realise the consequence. It isn't like smoking marijuana or drinking beer, where there is no natural moral opposition within human nature.>Furthermore, in such a case both society and the child would draw much more benefits from trying to understand and rehabilitate the child rather than decide to send the child in prison for lifeIt would appear so in this case that not only rehabilitation, but also a lesser sentence or acquittal is justified if it were indeed an abusive environment. But I would say the same thing in the case of a soldier severely mistreated by a commanding officer, or a wife maltreated by her husband. This has nothing to do with not ""fully realising"" the consequences due to age, but an understandable reaction of an animal that acted in a sub-optimal way (yes, we humans are animals and we are rarely as rational as most would like to think; btw, by sub-optimal I mean the optimal solution would be doing something like going to the police to make a complaint, something which many people in abusive situations are psychologically unable to do and therefore react in a sub-optimal way towards their aggressor). >she will be eligible for parole after 20 years behind the bars, she'll have spent more than 50% of her life behind the bars, how do you expect her to integrate in the non-carceral society then?I don't disagree.

7323,1,"> True enough... and i'd like to add that I hope that the average person would agree that legalizing the distribution of drugs (all drugs, including marijuana) by anyone (essentially, legalizing the profession of 'drug dealer') is not necessarily the best course of action.The average American citizen apparently thinks marijuana will make you insane. Food for thought.> Putting someone in prison for small possession isn't the answer either, but that isn't necessarily the case everywhere in the world... at least not here in Canada. Small possession (possession without intent to sell) isn't a felony, and you won't go to jail... in fact, it's unlikely you'd even be charged at all.I didn't realize you were Canadian. That changes some aspects, as the perception of illicit drugs is quite different in America than in the rest of the western/developed world.> On the flip side, people distributing drugs should be put in jail... Why? What crime have they committed *just* from distributing drugs that warrants a prison sentence? I don't think *any* non-violent offender should be in jail. Period.> ...their actions do affect others. The drug war, and the war on drugs are two different things, those contributing to the drug war (gangs, distribution networks) should be fought...People should be put in jail for the side-effects of the drug war (violence, theft, etc), but there are existing laws to handle those individuals. People that aren't harming anyone but are simply delivering a product that is in demand should be allowed to open a business just like everyone else -- it's ridiculous that we allow multi-billion dollar tobacco companies to operate freely but won't do the same for other harmful substances. > One thing I can promise... allowing legal distribution of drugs (even through a pharmacist) will not lessen the illegal underground drug trade...I don't think you understand the concept of a black market. If drugs were legal they would be cheaper and safer, they could be regulated, and people that got ripped off by a distributor could go to the authorities to solve the problem rather than taking it on themselves. I might agree that legalized drugs wouldn't necessarily lessen the overall use of drugs, but it would by definition lessen the illegal trade of drugs because most of that trade would, ya know, *no longer be illegal*.> There is no way that at some point in the future, you will be able to go to the crack store and buy some crack like you can go to the booze store... that's just not going to happen in my lifetime. I hope.Why is that such a bad thing? People are going to use whatever substance they feel like, and making said substance illegal hasn't stopped them or prevented them from doing so. If such drugs were sold at a store, at least they would have dosage recommendations and the product itself could be monitored to make sure it wasn't mixed with poison or whatnot.Keep in mind that alcohol was illegal in America at one time. There was a huge back market (which is where NASCAR came from, incidentally) that all but disappeared overnight once alcohol was re-legalized. It's entirely possible to ruin your life with alcohol -- in fact, I'd say it is more likely for an alcoholic to ruin his and loved ones' lives than for a pothead to do the same -- so why the double-standard? Where do we draw the line between ""recreational substance"" and ""so dangerous that it's better people obtain it through violence""?

7415,1,"What? Well there is one thing I noticed from being a hoodlum teenager. First I will say this. No drug of any quality ever came out of a minority neighborhood. Sorry guys you stomp on your coke too much, your weed is tree bark, and your E is blatant caffeine pills. White people and minorities deal drugs differently from what I have seen.1) In the suburbs everything is word of mouth, no one stands outside and tries to sling their shit. There are no houses blasting music with 8 cars parked outside. Many dealers do not just randomly start taking new customers that want to buy OZ every day. You have to work your way up the ladder. 2) There are no turf wars, everything is supply and demand. If you start losing customers you don't go out and shoot 4 innocent by standers to get to the other guy, you find a better product and get your customers back.3) White people by and large do not embrace a single subculture (other than dumb suburban kids) that identifies with and celebrates criminality. I have seen soccer mom dealers, preacher smokers, golf pro dealers, hick dealers, architects, 4th grade math teachers...the list goes on. Never in my life did I drive down into the seedy section of town and buy off a presentable minority in a three piece suit. Virtually every single time the person fit the profile.I think these three reasons are why cops focus on the minority dealers. They are easy to spot. I don't think cops care so much about drug dealing as they do about how blatant it is or how much crime rises in the neighborhood. Plus it is a money thing, you smash down the door of the wrong house in the suburbs the cops may find themselves giving the rest of their yearly budget to a pissed off home owner and his lawyer. In poor neighborhood, not so much.
"
7476,1,"I think that depends on whether or not you are caught actually buying what you believe to be illegal narcotics or whether you are only found to be in possession of what you believe to be illegal narcotics.Just as dealers can be prosecuted for selling catnip if they are selling it as marijuana, if you are caught in the process of buying said catnip because you thought it was marijuana then you're still guilty of attempting to buy marijuana.

It *can* make it significantly more difficult for people to get excited about things. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying that it does create a lack of motivation, or more specifically, it makes you perfectly complacent with being bored. While for times that can be a very welcome sentiment, it is not the best thing when younger kids are trying to find direction in life.To get to the original discussion topic: The gov't doesn't really have the constitutional right to do so, but that doesn't matter anymore we've learned. They don't follow the rules. The bottom line is that legalization and taxation is probably the best compromise. It will kill the cartels (at least the marijuana ones), provide revenue, and somewhat restrict it to minors. I see no downside. It's not like people will be paying more than they do now. It will also allow for botanical researchers to get creative. Finally, if it becomes an industry, it will get more investments. I think most people here would approve.

My guess is that the majority knows how to handle it.It's a bit like traffic regulations. The system works (kinda) but some people are still getting hurt (no, not always by their own faults.)

272,0,". . .Obama's lines here are impressive, and brave -- basically tough love for members of the African-American community:And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean. If we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to King's vision of a beloved community.We have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them. The scourge of anti-Semitism has, at times, revealed itself in our community. For too long, some of us have seen immigrants as competitors for jobs instead of companions in the fight for opportunity.Every day, our politics fuels and exploits this kind of division across all races and regions; across gender and party. It is played out on television. It is sensationalized by the media. And last week, it even crept into the campaign for President, with charges and counter-charges that served to obscure the issues instead of illuminating the critical choices we face as a nation. So let us say that on this day of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts and minds. The division, the stereotypes, the scape-goating, the ease with which we blame our plight on others -- all of this distracts us from the common challenges we face -- war and poverty; injustice and inequality.We can no longer afford to build ourselves up by tearing someone else down. We can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear or hate. It is the poison that we must purge from our politics; the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too late.Because if Dr. King could love his jailor; if he could call on the faithful who once sat where you do to forgive those who set dogs and fire hoses upon them, then surely we can look past what divides us in our time, and bind up our wounds, and erase the empathy deficit that exists in our hearts. --------------------------------------Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright. . .Ok, where's my doobie, y'all.

Like caffeine in coffee, the morphine is doing the actual altering of bodily function.Interestingly, by the same logic you are negating your opening sentence. THC is the active ingredient in weed; so like caffeine, THC would be the drug but not weed itself. In fact, as long as a discrete active ingredient could be isolated, no plants could be considered drugs.I don't think this is correct; I don't think you think this is correct; and I think xoctor had a good basis for arguing against it.
