51,1,"This country would be so screwed. Bill Clinton has no respect for the rights of the individual at all. None at all.> [In the Clinton years, police overreach in the name of the Drug War shredded much of what remained of the Bill of Rights. And those most frequently caught in its web were not the ""drug kingpins"" legislators claimed to be going after. Mothers, fathers, small-time dealers, medical-marijuana users and even children were caught in a criminal- justice system so overgrown no one is immune to the new powers Johnny Law uses to protect us from ourselves. And while much of the horror heaped on the American public has occurred at the state and local levels, the tenor of the times begins at the top-which places the responsibility squarely at Bill Clinton's feet](http://www.mapinc.org/newscfdp/v01/n087/a05.html?6793)

125,1,"This isn't the law though. Whether marijuana, wine or fruits & vegetables the government sets laws on what can or can't be shipped to the US.In lots of states you can't ship plants into it because of worries about plant diseases and bug infestations. I'm talking about asparagus, celery etc. here, not weed.Same with wine. Lots of states don't like alcohol to be shipped in their states. If you're a winery and want to sell your wine online you have to be aware of these laws. Ship wine to a consumer in Indiana and you can be arrested.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is ""justice"" at all. I'm just saying the act of shipping a product (any product) into the US can be illegal.

147,1,"> What happens to Utah's law that specifically outlaws marijuana by name? At least you're thinking and trying to understand now. Those are obviously state issues and Paul has said that the federal government won't interfere in these issues.> And you're wrong. Again with the smugness in your ignorance. The DEA cannot over-turn state drug lawsPaul has never said that he would overturn any state laws. I suspect you know this and are merely trying to discredit the positions he stands for. It probably is killing you that he is the only Republican candidate that actually wants to solve problems recognized by the reddit community as wrong. Try as you might, he supports legalization of drugs and you can't diminish this point.
"
173,1,"As far as the actual pot dealing... instead of this presidential candidate yall have who isn't going to win anyway, come to California and fight for states rights. We already did legalize it, the clubs are wildly popular, and the federales have to resort to dirty tactics like threatening landlords because they know they don't have political support. Conversely in many towns you can't be a viable candidate if you support criminalization of marijuana. In Frisco our police are supposed to get in trouble if they look for it in your home, our way of saying it's legal for recreational uses. If you toke up on the street though, you're supposed to have a prescription. Ok, I'm humorlessly preaching off topic, but I can never figure out how to get this message out... legalization in California is the real libertarian flashpoint in this country, and we need your help.
"
447,1,"A seminal study from the CATO Institute found:""Although consumption of alcohol fell at the beginning of Prohibition, it subsequently increased. Alcohol became more dangerous to consume; crime increased and became ""organized""; the court and prison systems were stretched to the breaking point; and corruption of public officials was rampant. No measurable gains were made in productivity or reduced absenteeism. Prohibition removed a significant source of tax revenue and greatly increased government spending. It led many drinkers to switch to opium, marijuana, patent medicines, cocaine, and other dangerous substances that they would have been unlikely to encounter in the absence of Prohibition.Those results are documented from a variety of sources, most of which, ironically, are the work of supporters of Prohibition--most economists and social scientists supported it.""http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1017There are detailed stats here also which say that crime did not fall during Prohibition:http://www.druglibrary.org/Prohibitionresults.htmNote that both these sources would not be considered neutral in this debate either. That's not to say they're not to be trusted, just pointing it out.

Obama said something about decriminalizing pot!Haven't you people noticed how fucking boring the front page gets when it's _all_ iraq iraq ron paul iraq ron paul cat? Same shit, everyday? This thread is about something people (in the US) should probably know about as well!Sheesh!

603,1,"< or they prefer another candidates more.alright yeah with that argument your definitely correct or else why wouldn't Paul be the GOP winner.I'm 19 and although I don't actually go to college, I've been around college kids enough to see that many of them would support Paul, hell a lot of people would want him just after hearing he would legalize pot haha. But more seriously people just think retarded stuff like Mccain doesn't like war, or Hilary Clinton is going to be like Bill Clinton, but even chiller. The same goes for people slightly older as well, the people I have no idea about are the ones near retirement age or already retired.Have you watched cnn or msnbc or any other news about politics? God damn that shit is so ridiculous. Actually listening to all the stupid shit they keep saying.
"
914,1,"Oh, I never knew that he actually possessed marijuana (2.17 grams the article says). All the other articles I had read failed to mention that fact.I say he should serve the sentence. He wasn't jailed for 4 years for the .0003grams, they just used that to arrest him, at which time they found the rest of his stash (which means it wasn't just an accident that he had weed on the soles of his shoes).If Dubai wants to be strict about drug possession, they are a sovereign country, and they can set their own laws. Don't be pissed just because they happen to be better at finding said drugs.*edit8 Guh scrum is correct...if all they had was the .0003 grams then yah getting sent to jail for 4 years is idiotic.
"
1029,1,"It is nice! In Berlin, Hamburg and some other german cities you can sit in a Park, puffin' away your weed and the cops won't care as long as nobody complains or you try to sell it.I had 3 quite big Plants of Mary-Jane in the window and the cops applauded my growing skills when they saw them.Disclaimer: Don't try this in southern Germany, you'll go to jail before you can say ""wtf?""!
"
1117,1,"also, lets not forget that it's going to be IMPOSSIBLE to enforce. Unlike weed, salvia looks EXACTLY like a sage plant, you can grow it in your front yard and nobody would ever notice it.
"
1126,1,"Incidentally, the article is from 1977, and the authors were strangely optimistic that legalization would happen in the near future:> To propose that our government stop making war on prostitution may seem quixotic. But American attitudes toward sex have been changing rapidly. The notion of a young couple openly living together or college clinics routinely providing birth-control devices would have been as shocking to most Americans a generation ago as toleration or regulation of prostitution is today. Furthermore, legislatures and the public in some states have begun to recognize how costly it is to use criminal sanctions against consensual behaviorâ€”evidenced by softening or removal of criminal penalties for public drunkenness, smoking marijuana, gambling, and abortions.> It does not depreciate the depth of concern about prostitution itself to recognize that the police are not about to eliminate the oldest profession. Indeed, its durability suggests it is time to take note that there are ways to provide sex for money that are acceptable to prostitutes, law enforcement officials, and the surrounding communities; and to speculate about the form decriminalization or legalization might take in American cities.
"
1195,1,"Good points. There is an enormous amount of money in drug criminalization. However, even if simple marijuana criminalization went away, there would still be other drugs and especially other crimes to prosecute. While taking one crime out of the lawbook might have a significant effect on law enforcement, it would not wholly destroy their jobs. I see the real reluctance coming just as much, or more, from progressive moralists, the prison-industrial complex, the cotton industry, the tobacco industry, and the petrol industry. There may just be too many special interests who don't want people to grow their own pot. But, maybe not. We need to keep trying, even if it seems impossible.
"
1207,1,"Don't worry, pot will still be illegal in China.
"
1354,1,"is anybody bothered by the fact that many presidents, elite businessmen etc etc have used drugs and used prostitutes....and they are still outlawed to the average person. We hear that clinton smoked pot....who cares right? We just assume he can get away with it, while people who grow/distribute/use get fucked under his administration. I can't wait for the day when a politician grows some balls and says ""yep, I tripped my balls on acid in the sixties, and I'm fine now. That's why it should be legalized."" It's just logic peeps.
"
1460,1,"Easy. Prostitution is regulated and legal.The hell with marijuana, I'd be blowing all my spare cash on the hot hookers. :)
"
1501,1,"I don't agree with life in prison for growing pot. That being said this guy is getting life in prison for stupidity. He knew he had 2 strikes.
"
1502,1,"meth isnt like pot. pot has medicinal uses, industry uses, and the potential for decriminalization like alcohol. meth leaves people looking like zombies.
"
1503,1,">Growing 1000 plants will cost you money as long as it's a crime.The question here is... who does it cost? ""You"" is the correct term, because your (citizens') money is being wasted on this. Billions of your hard-earned dollars wasted because **big corporations** realized that cannabis has all sorts of applications that could **hurt their profit margins** simply because **cannabis is naturally grown** and can replace many chemicals and other things that they **make lots of money off of.**The three strikes rule for anti-corporate activity also helps them out, since they can **make money off of our prisons.**
"
1539,1,"Yes. Are you willing to apply the base logic to everything, not just your pot pleasure? Such as all drugs, women topless in public, and <18 pornography being legal?
"
1638,1,"No, just that many are. While I do *believe* that most people drink wine without getting sloshed, I did not posit that and that's not my argument. I believe I answered the question: *a* reason pot is illegal that does not also apply to at least some forms of alcohol.I've certainly known my share of folks who drink wine with a meal and many folks who smoke pot.I know *many* people who smoke pot to get high. I know *of* people who smoke pot to alleviate pain or certain glaucoma symptoms. I know *no* people who smoke pot in small enough quantities that there are insignificant pharmacological effects and just because they like the flavor.On the other hand, while I do know people who drink to get high. I know *more* people who drink, but do not get drunk.Clearly (from my downvotes I see), redditors in general drink only to get drunk. I do not believe this is representative of society as a whole.'Hope this helps.
"
1639,1,"Well for one, the people they arrest for drugs tend to be the dumbest ones therefore creating a group of drug dealers which are smarter as a whole and more capable of distribution.Second, if pot were legal then the people selling it wouldn't also be selling cocaine and heroin (as a lot of drug dealers do markup on weed is dismal compared to the other two I mentioned). Thus negating the alleged _gateway drug_ claims made by the anti drugists.
"
1753,1,"uh speaking of capitalism and marijuana, i think the fact that the drug is bought and sold in a pure free market (untaxed and unregulated by the very nature of it being illegal) means that basically everyone makes a buck off of itso yes, it's capitalism. but who says it's a bad thing?
"
1759,1,"I thought Bill's whole thing was that he didn't inhale. Also, as an ex-President, I'm sure he's well-known to many members of Congress already. How does introducing him in Congress decriminalize marijuana?
"
1774,1,"It doesn't decriminalize marijuana exactly, it eliminates federal penalties of possession for up to 100 grams (3.5 ounces). Your state is likely to have penalties on top of that.
"
1799,1,"None. The only just solution is to legalize it retroactively, and to wipe all Federal marijuana related convictions off the books.
"
2003,1,"Yeah, I did a paper on Canadian politics a year ago. Canada is just, I don't know, fascinating. If I could move there and find work and citizenship, I would. Anecdote about loose law enforcement in Canada:In America, we got headshops where you can buy bongs, bowls and other smoke accessories. However, even saying ""weed"" or the word ""bong"" can get you in trouble with the store owners, as they are constantly busted and monitored.In Canada, in Toronto, I bought a bowl, and the headshop owner sold me weed on the spot. Damn.
"
2032,1,"The Attorney General never gets to this point in the administrative process, their office doesn't intervene. Both offices are executive agencies. The president controls them both. The DEA gets the first say in whether cannabis can be researched. The same agency (created by Nixon) that is busting medical pot clubs on the west coast also gets to decide the terms of research on the plant. >that case involves the denial of permission to GROW marijuana. It doesn't address the issue of whether he may obtain it through some other means and possess it for purposes of research.Are you retarded or something...You want a university to support criminal drug dealers? The only supply the DEA allows is the federal crop, which is grown at the U.MISS facility, but is documented shwag, a stemmy, seedy mess of 1-2% THC (the stuff that is sent to the handful of federally legal patients by the govt). That is the issue, they don't want quality marijuana to be tested. Lyle Craker only is asking to be able to grow better quality cannabis which can reach 25% THC and there are a variety of strains with different cannabinoid compounds and effects. The seeds can be legally obtained through vendors in europe. It would be easy to set up if they just ok'd it. Obviously they are hiding the facts, or they wouldn't limit testing to bunk weed.
"
2040,1,"The people bringing in cocaine are generally dangerous and have even meaner lawyers. Much more fun to go bust down the doors of some immigrant family they think may be growing pot so they can pay the rent.
"
2138,1,"But... until laws are also passed that prevent employers from discriminating against employees who use pot in their free time, I could easily see the gov't making a list and making it so any employer could find you and not hire you because you happen to enjoy eating, smoking, and/or vaporizing a plant.
"
2191,1,"well, i'm not convinced that a society where it's socially acceptable to be stoned is a good place to live. binge drinking culture is bad enough.and also, i don't buy the whole 'cannabis is harmless' thing. sure, i believe people should have the freedom to ingest what they want, so long as they are not harming anybody else, but because i don't believe cannabis to be a harmless drug i think it should be legalized pragmatically so as to protect people from it. my life would certainly have been a lot better if i hadn't been introduced to it at 15. so what i'm saying is, maybe giving complete freedom to the people is a worthy ideal, but not a practical one.
"
2272,1,"Maybe he got busted for a victimless ""crime"" like selling pot and is in prison now and unable to support his family, which clearly needs support. We just don't know about this epidemic of ""absent"" dads, do we?
"
2273,1,"8) Ever heard about Bill C-26? They want to lump marijuana in with coke and meth and heroin and put mandatory prison sentences on people who sell pot. It fucked the U.S royally and now their prisons are full of non violent criminals who come out with their lives ruined and then turn to real crime. http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/5171.htmlBill C-26 is a huge huge deal.
"
2274,1,"give me a break there is a reasonable expectation for enforcement of laws. did you hear san francisco put pot possession on the bottom of its priority last year even though possession is still illegal?
"
2482,1,"yeah I heard, it's gonna be the first animated xkcd.Totally awesome when they find a way to make guns out of hemp and thus it makes weed constitutionally legal.And somewhere in the middle the nation gets rickroll'd. And then again right when the credits come up.
"
2568,1,">In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana. Especially considering that Washington and Jefferson forced their slaves to grow cannabis on their plantations. Yes, Clarence Thomas summed it up quite nicely.
"
2978,1,"The social stigma that you speak of, in regards to pot exists, but if you are in the Bay Area, it's probably harder to find. I once saw Bill Maher live and he put the words Anne Coulter and orgasm together in a sentence, floundering for a laugh, and I haven't been able to forgive him since. I can understand you holding that comment against him.I think you might need to qualify your statement about pilots; are you talking airline pilots? They're not any more likely to show up to work stoned than a surgeon is; it's detailed work, a relatively tough job to get and one that many of them are proud of. I have known people who did fly small (we're talking like Piper Cub small) aircraft under the influence of alcohol, but nobody rode with them- either other pilots or passengers. General statements and the ""before you know it"" type stuff is a little hysterical, a little reefer madness sounding to me. The basic guideline I'm seeing here is treating it like alcohol. In most schools, if a teacher heads out to their car on lunch for a quick drink, other teachers are going to notice and their ass will be roasted for it. Pot's not that easy to conceal and when Ms. Mary Jane or Mr. Pot Herb rolls in smelling of lavender or patchouli, the kids will notice and the other teachers will too. Making it legal does not sanction indiscriminate use.I feel that this might be a conflation of one person's perception of an addictive personality with other people's behavioral traits. I don't think that we need to prevent people, particularly teachers, doctors, pilots (hmm, these are all professions that require higher education- you leave out trash collectors, steel workers and taxi drivers) from doing what they wish on their off time, beyond industry regulations. For example, most airlines stipulate a 12 hour period between having a drink and going to work. And for some people, it is a performance enhancing substance. It's good that some people recognize their problems with different substances and desist on using them, but I think it may sensitize them to those of us who can use it with little or no ill effect and feel free to speak our minds about it.
"
3051,1,"Like arresting people for possession of poppy seeds and microscopic traces of marijuana?
"
3080,1,"In some EU countries the use or possession of weed is decriminalized, but nowhere is it legal. In countries like Spain, Italy, Belgium and Ireland you will only receive a fine or suspension of your drivers license if caught. The only difference in Holland is that possession of up to 5 grams for personal use is tolerated (but still illegal!). What most people don't understand is that it's tolerated as long as it's not used in public places and you're not causing a nuisance. Every weekend in Amsterdam you see stoned tourists making asses of themselves in public because they think they're in la-la land. They are the ones you later see in back of a police van crying ""I thought it was legal!"".
"
3196,1,"To make the idea palatable to the federal government activists for legalization frequently toss the tax bone out. The idea is that a multiple-billions dollar crop like marijuana would be very profitable for the government. Unfortunately, the fact is that if the growth of marijuana wasn't illegal then the price of the product would drop down near zero and there would be little to gain from taxing a plant most people would grow in their own houses anyways.

Candi and I will be traveling across America busting crookedcopsand catching it on film. The show is similar to ""CHEATERS"" except we will becatching the police in illegal acts...prostitution, drugs, DWI, etc. Eachepisode will feature a ""capture"" and will portray the idea that Americans wantpolice officers protecting us but do not want the abusive police forces thatreign today.It's seems difficult to get Americans to stand up to law enforcement even whenthey are extremely bitter toward them. I've seen citizens who justifiably""hate"" cops because of past abusive encounters treat the police as if theywerekin when in front of one! I think this phenomenon exists because mostAmericanswant to obey and respect authority and when encountering a ""person ofauthority""they tend to wilt with submission. I recommend if a cop is rude, point out howrude he is and be rude back! Then go to his superiors and be rude with themwhile complaining. If all citizens behaved in this manner, the rude andabusiveindividuals would constantly be reported and hopefully fired. The police arehere to serve and protect us and are suppose to be defenders of ourconstitution. The uniformed officers are not ""secret police"" that can't beapproached or questions. They are public servants.I watched a new show on TRUE TV called, PartyHeat. If you want to see anexample of how police in America SHOULD act, watch this show. The episode Isawtracked a California State Police squad as they encountered wild parties on thelake. The police were seen issuing citations only for marijuana and arrestingboat drivers who were way over the limit and posing a danger to otherpartygoers. They were very polite, professional and socially fun as theyworkedto keep the lake a safe place for everybody. I wished the rest of America waslike this!

3368,1,"The conservative Christian party and the right-wing Swiss People's Party will probably both recommend a 'no'.You bet they will recommend a no. There's actually an Evangelical party gaining strength and the UDC/SVP right-wing-xenophobic-fear-mongering party.And by the way, this is at least the second time the Swiss get to vote on legalizing cannabis. I seriously doubt it'll pass this time.
"
3488,1,"It is really interesting to see what these people are saying about their drugs. Especially the heroin lawyer and the crack cocaine bum. I don't do any drugs, but I do smoke weed. What the guy said about smoking it and showering, and how nature is just amazing after smoking is dead on.

3651,1,"I love how the first commenter argues ""Yes! Therefore we must legalize marijuana!""Lolarious
"
3831,1,"marijuana prevents cancer?Please buddy.. I am for legalizing but you are telling me that breathing in the black smoke of a burnt plant prevents cancer?? Check the black sticky tar left in a used bong..You are telling me that this black tar is actually good for you? Please, send me the link to this 'study'
"
3855,1,"How about instead of blaming me for your perceived issue (perceived because it really doesn't matter if the stuff is decriminalized or not you're going to smoke it anyway), you try and be active in the community that is trying to decriminalize/legalize?While I will admit there was a definite lack of self control, as a kid, you're curious and you do stupid things. Is that a cop-out from me? I don't think so, because how did you start smoking? Bottom line, stop acting like a victim, your ""way of life"" isn't at all threatened by the choices of me, or my friends, or any of the other hard drug users. In fact, even if your government managed to completely outlaw weed, which I would have a hard time believing, it wouldn't be so much as a blip in the radar of the prices that you're buying at, it wouldn't change anything. If you've got such a big problem, move to Canada, where possession is a misdemeanor charge at most, and often times the cops won't give two and a half shits if you're just smoking a joint with your buddies.

3899,1,"anyone else notice that in the past 50 years consumption of illicit substances have also increased by a large amount?for example from 1979 to 2006 the number of cannabis users nearly doubled (50mil to 98mil)while certainly not a primary cause due to multiple substance use, it is definitely a contributing factor
"
3940,1,"What probably shouldn't surprise me is that we have so many excellent medical facilities capable of showing that pot isn't that bad. I've read that it can be very beneficial to people with wasting illnesses and there's certainly worse things people can get their hands on legally. I suspect there is some sort of establishment movement which is gumming up any movements towards legalization here.Mass is liberal but it is certainly not a ""Live free or die"" state like our neighbors to the north.

But you cant just say ""Lol its your own problem"" and let the drug dealers have full reign wherever they want. Not all drugs are equal either in danger, like weed is pretty non lethal but much of the other shit is dangerous and addictive as hell. Also the upward movement of many of the lower classes is stopped because of it or is futile in the first place and those people turned to drug dealing as way out. Your right those problems cant be solved by putting one or hundred men into jail but there needs to be a punishment so immediate action can be taken, so criminal elements can stay off the streets.It is not always your decision either that to simply say to your children ""Dont do drugs"" especially when that rebellious phase comes about and minds congregate. Lets say there's a drug dealer on the corner where your kids get dropped off. He offers some smack for free , your kid is pressured by other around him doing the same and suddenly he is hooked. While certainly that would not be the end of it if that drug dealer got caught in our world, in your world where a drug dealer would face no crime for what he would be doing he would stay there dealing out dope like it was nothing lower the property values bringing in more criminal elements and you or the police would have nothing to stop him. Basically what you want is far worse than what already is. You talk about your own responsibility eh? Well its not my responsibility to take care for at risk kids who become drug dealers now is it? Let them rot in jail, it is what law calls for. Let them be dumb and ignorant to their own downfalls a million generations over forever in poverty, not my responsibility right? You cant get rid of the problem but you can certainly marginalize it and that's what anti drug forces accomplish.

4353,1,"What I love about this story is that the cops in Toronto actually set up a sting to catch this guy.Meanwhile, cops in the USA have to be shamed into investigating anything less serious than the murder of a public figure or a bank robbery. Dangerous, violent criminals in the USA know they have a free pass to commit everything from arson to home-invasion robbery, because cops are more interested in going after jazz musicians for smoking pot.I'm not making that up. Here in my own city, we've had a slew of terrifying home-invasion robberies, and the cops are bungling the investigation in a way that seems almost calculated. Meanwhile, they're aggressively patrolling the small club strip downtown looking for anyone who might be smoking a joint in a parking lot.

So, this is just more propaganda.Propaganda is dishonest at its core.

4819,1,"Violence isn't the problem, *aggression* is the problem. Defending one's self against a murderer should not be seen in the same light as murder itself. At the same time, the government forces 800,000 non-violent marijuana users a year into jail. The real question is: as what point do we start defending ourselves against aggression of all kinds?

5104,1,"It depends entirely on what you mean by ""master""... if there is something that Bush does not want Canada to do, then yes, there are multiple examples of the Canadian government casting aside the desires of its citizenry and instead following the desires of Bush.Sheer numbers are useless. You asserted that Canada gives its citiens more freedom concerning pot laws. If I am misinformed on Canadian law, please enlighten me, but is possession of marijuana a crime? Is growing marijuana a crime? Is consuming marijuana a crime? Is it legal for employers to test you for marijuana use and fire you if you are found to have indulged? Yes, the government of Canada planned to relax their laws concerning the legal status of pot after BC decriminalized the way Colorado and other states in the US have... but they did not execute those plans. Bush went on TV and gave a speech saying that it would be very disappointing if one of our closest allies didn't cooperate in controlling the evil demon weed, etc, and the Canadian government capitulated and dropped all pretense of legalization.I'm saying that Canada is just as hard on pot as the USA and the reason that it has not been legalized in Canada is solely and entirely to please Bush.What are the Canadian laws concerning medical marijuana? I assume from your stance that Canada treats mj more ""lightly"" that it's legalized? Or maybe more territories have legalized its medicinal use than states in the US? I will grant you that the US is better at enforcing its laws, but as far as I can see, Canada gets its laws from the USA and when they want to change them, the USA stops them.

5225,1,"But the fact remains that you would still arrest him for carrying a small amount of cannabis, because you feel it won't do any/much harm to the life of that kid. What if he had plans to go into the service and put his life on the line for what *he* feels is a noble cause. If he has one drug charge, that could make it impossible, or extremely difficult. I agree with you on most points you have made in this thread, but the prosecution of someone for cannabis is, to me, outrageous. I feel as a police officer you are obligated to make decisions beneficial to the people of you patrolled area, and someone who enjoys a moderate amount of cannabis is usually no threat to the people surrounding. Look at alcohol and the hurt it causes, look at the death it causes, and we are still allowed to have a few drinks and then drive afterward. I'm not debating the fact that alcohol is legal and cannabis is not, I'm simply trying to push my point that someone who posses cannabis, in most cases, is not worthy of receiving any kind of punishment. I grew-up in an area (Lake County, CA) that was very lenient toward cannabis use, mainly because of the meth epidemic, and the most they would do on a bad day is dump out your cannabis. The understanding shown was greatly appreciated, and gave me a new respect for The Man, LoL. If you have a crack problem, focus more attention on that that someone who will occasionally enjoy a cannabis, please!

5349,1,"Key indeed. He's now against us. If you vote for someone who is willing to say whatever it takes to get elected, you're voting for someone willing to sell their soul for personal gain. Once they sell their soul, its not likely to return. And, I think the 10s of billions we're using to lock up pot smokers is a big issue that effects the economy. If cannabis was a legal medicine it would reduce health care costs. The FDA works for big pharma companies, so they won't treat it as a medicine. It cant be patented effectively when you can grow it in an empty lot. There would be far less need for the high priced sleep pills, anxiety pills, pain pills, that drive up the cost of health care. Yes it is a huge issue that filters into many other areas of concern.

"
6126,1,"The one thing our costly and futile efforts to ""eradicate"" marijuana have accomplished is to create a boom for criminal gangs, to whom we've handed a monopoly on production and distribution. Unlike producers of legal drugs like beer, wine or tobacco, these criminals pay no taxes and obey no rules. Their illicit efforts despoil our national forests and bring violence and destabilization to Mexico.For years, politicians who know our current marijuana laws make no sense have been afraid to change them for fear of political retribution. The voters' thundering rejection of our misguided war on marijuana shows that those fears are misplaced.It's time for Congress and the new administration -- not to mention state governments around the country -- to listen to the public. It's time for a new approach.

"
6289,1,"That I am not so sure about, because it would have a lot of effects on other laws, and would get a lot of attention. I do think he will stop federal agents from focusing on Marijuana weather for medical purposes or not because it is a waste of money, and it can be done simply. I think he may push for decriminalization at the federal level in his second term, but not in his first. I think stopping the federal raids will allow states to fully develop their medical marijuana programs. After that the country would have an example to look at rather than arguing through speculation. Then it would be easier for him politically to reclassify it.
"
6324,1,"Another good case for legalization. People are being arrested and sent to jail because police enter their home on an unrelated manner and see evidence of marijuana use. Most police will tell you that they have better things to do than bust people for smoking pot in their own homes, but in order to follow the law they have to report it when they see it.Legalizing marijuana would have two benefits in this scenario. Police would have more resources to arrest and incarcerate dangerous people if they didn't have to treat responsible marijuana users like criminals. It would also increase the chances that marijuana users would report crimes where they were the witness or the victim because they would not have to worry about unintentionally incriminating themselves.

6470,1,"I used to date the Dean's daughter. Funny thing is, I didn't realize it, until I went over to her place for dinner, low and behold, her Dad was the dean. He was uptight and strict, I was cool and easy going. I was frequently late to class, but I always managed to get a good grade because I had pictures of the professors in compromising positions, except in economics, where the dean put pressure on his former roommate and my current professor to go hard on me, or risk his tenure.Of course, after being framed for cheating on the dean's daughter (by a jealous girl), the dean decides to crack down on my ultimate frisbee team, and his daughter dumped me for Chester ""Chet"" Ayleton, captain of the row team and pre-law club.I was therefore tasked with throwing the greatest party on campus, to raise the money needed to save ""Spankee Stadium"", as our field is affectionately known.It wasn't be easy, I needed my best ""bud"" Tweezer to use his connections selling weed to the campus to help. (He ended up rigging the police station AC unit to be a huge smoke room, getting campus security high on our party night.) I also needed to shape up, and get good grades in school to prove to the dean's daughter I could love her and be a real man.In the end, everything worked out. The dean tried his darndest to stop us, but we managed to raise a lot of money. At the last minute, after sharing an extended kiss with the dean's daugher, the dean declares he respects me... and then reveals my failing grade in business class, thus kicking me out of the school and forfeitting my scholarship, meaning I'd have to spend the party money on my tuition, or get arrested.At the last minute, my previously impish economics professor got revenge on the dean after many years of solitude, and gives me an A because the party showed I was good at economics, and I earned it.The dean then cries out he'll get me for this, in which he slips into a puddle of goat poop. (As a goat we get high is our team mascot), and swears, running off.Oh wait, that's not my life, that's just a generic college comedy.

6513,1,"http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc08/medicine/altered.html> US Attorney Eric Holder urged District Council Member Charlene Jarvis (D) to introduce legislation increasing marijuana penalties within the District.

Currently, marijuana offenses are a misdemeanor in the District, regardless of the amount.>> In response to the proposed legislation, members of the AIDS advocacy group ACT-UP Washington, DC filed papers with the Board of Elections and Ethics for a ballot initiative to legalize the medical use of marijuana.I only post that because the feds have [closed down all the medicinal marijuana shops in town](http://safeaccessnow.org/blog/?p=181) and Obama promised to change that.

Now I will spew some cliche Libertarian rhetoric.""As a college student majoring in Cognitive Science, I can assure you that addiction does not have to involve anything harmful. Also, chocolate and sex have incredibly different effects on the reward system, so I don't know why you grouped them together. There are also no conclusive studies on how marijuana affects the reward system, so congratulations on figuring out that mechanism.As for your last few sentences there, great job belittling those with genetic differences that cause their addiction pathways to be particularly resilient to deconstructive mechanisms. Your response to their nonexistent threat to take away your weed really impressed me.

I think that he is agreeing that marijuana smokers lack of self-analysis is what leads to us being seen as just a bunch of stoners who complain that our drug of choice is illegal. I though that this was an agreement that if marijuana legalization people want to be taken seriously, that they should probably clean up their act (at least the portion of their act that involves publicly advocating for legalization).So thats what I thought, until I posted, reread the original blog post, and THEN realized that when he said ""our society's arrogance"" he meant all of society, not just the marijuana smokers. Yeah, society is FUCKED, but thats NEVER going to change. Especially if you are not willing to work within society's constraints to try to change those constraints.Like it or not, that's just not the way politics works. You gotta play the system to change the system. Do you think your Senator likes wearing a suit every day? Do you think that every now and again he wouldn't fucking LOVE to show up wearing pajama pants and a humorous t-shirt? The reason he deals with it and wears a suit is because hes got BIGGER SHIT TO DO.----Also, I wanted to point out a few things about this post.

Should people be allowed to get high, THAT is the political bullshit. The science only factors in when they weigh the pros and cons. The science is in Marijuana's favor as it is relativity harmless, but it is about SO much more than just the science.

6970,1,"The DEA, which places drugs on their ""schedules"" and can decriminalize cannabis with an internal rule change, is an arm of the executive branch controlled by the Office of the President. You thought wrong and you've failed your daily civics exam.
"
6977,1,"I doubt it - generally his statements in regards to decriminalization have been lukewarm at best. Officially, he's not interested in pursuing a drastic change in America's drug policy, and the only thing he seems to have put any weight behind is that he wants to end federal raids on growers in states that have already decriminalized it to some degree (such as for medical purposes).Frankly, Obama has bigger fish to fry, at least in his first term - the economy, two wars, and undoing the harmful actions of the previous administration will likely take up most of his focus in the next four years.If things go well in regards to these issues and Obama is reelected, he'll still have to contend with a massive budget deficit (which will undoubtedly be worse because of measures he'll need to take to address the economy), revamping America's healthcare, the search for Bin Laden, likely escalating tensions with Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and possibly Pakistan... and if he really wants to follow in Lincoln's footsteps as he claims, at some point he may want to change his stance on gay marriage and attempt to include sexual orientation in America's discrimination laws.Even if Obama genuinely wanted to tackle this issue, it would be difficult to do so without first building up his presidential credentials - marijuana and its users have a somewhat negative public image, and it would be politically dangerous to jump into this issue when pundits will easily be able to use it to label him as a ""stoner's president"". Once he's solidified his reputation, though, it may be possible for him to return to the issue.I'm not saying it won't happen, but I am saying don't count on it, and I wouldn't blame Obama in the least if he opted not to address it until his second term, if at all.

7902,1,"Ok, that's actually convinced me a bit that marijuana in traffic isn't as dangerous as I thought. Still:> They were treated on separate occasions with marijuana cigarettes containing THC doses of 0 (placebo), 100, 200, and 300 g/kg.Relative minor dosages, maybe there are actual dangers with higher dosages. Also:> If any subject would have reacted in an unacceptable manner to a lower dose, he/she would not have been permitted to receive a higher dose.That's quite a bias, it's for safety but still. Not entirely convinced but good point.Edit:and:> Although THC's adverse effects on driving performance appeared relatively small in the tests employed in this program, one can still easily imagine situations where the influence of marijuana smoking might have a dangerous effect; i.e., emergency situations which put high demands on the driver's information processing capacity, prolonged monotonous driving, and after THC has been taken with other drugs, especially alcohol. Because these possibilities are real, the results of the present studies should not be considered as the final word.

7904,1,"> There is no way to tell if someone is driving under the influence of illegal drugs, alcohol, over the counter drugs, prescription drugs, or anything else while observing from the outside of the car. You can, however, detect someone who is driving unsafe - regardless of what they look like. Unsafe driving includes things like swerving, veering, going too fast, driving into oncoming traffic, etc.I meant by the person driving himself, with very little planning (taxi, bus etc.) these sort of situations can be prevented.> So, logophobia, who will deem the criteria for who is and isn't a ""responsible driver?"" Should we trust the ever beneficent Legislators to the task? What if I am a safe driver both sober and under the influence of marijuana? What if marijuana has next to no effect on my driving skills? The Righteous Legislator must know what is best for me personally, and will sculpt a fair and just law, right?The right way to go about it would be to determine what the dosage is where driver performance is affected (if there is one, I am not entirely sure) to a dangerous degree for most people with a scientific study. Driving above that limit should then be illegal. Maybe I have a bit more confidence in my government to do such things right. I have less bad experiences in my country with regard of power abuses by the the government then you seem to have. A different perspective I guess. > The point is, you cannot legislate safety - nor should you try. The government isn't there to protect you from yourself, but it has been warped to do so at great cost to everyone's liberties. Since busybodies have passed laws to protect people from themselves, we now have The War on Drugs, a failed and violent movement that robs innocent people of their possessions and lines the government's pockets. We now have police speeding ticket quotas - some states require police to collect a certain amount of tickets a month! What if nobody was speeding that month? Well, in the promotion of public safety, the police will just have to keep an eye out for people who ""look"" like marijuana users - you know, young, non-standard haircuts, black, etc. Or anyone else they can abuse the rights of and get away with it.I am not saying that your governments current approach is a good one, but not regulating road safety is not a good alternative. That means other people can violate *my* rights for some reasonable safety on the road. Yes, there are abuses of power by the government, things like that should be dealt with. Each law has it's advantages and disadvantages, but giving up the right up the right to be *excessively* drugged up or drunk in traffic is a small price to pay for road safety. I am not condoning government power abuses, but that's a bit a separate issue.

"
6416,0,"I'll share some related stories. Stalking can be real. I had a coworker with a exboyfriend like that. As a student, a ~55 yr old adjunct teacher (who wrote this review http://www.indiastar.com/sethi.html) who hung out at a cafe irrationally demanded money after I had casually mentioned that I was dealing with an insurance company when I broke my arm when I was hit by a car. He decided he had given me advice in this conversation and was owed legal fees, and he figured out my name and went to my job and found my phone number. Anyhow, in Berkeley, in a victorian house with 8 units, we had a schizophrenic neighbor who was delusional, and decided that the blue collar man downstairs was a drug dealing, child molester etc. and he started sending dozens of threatening postcards, saying that he would call the police and describing what Dave had been wearing that day (because he was watching). Then one day, six police officers were on the porch with a warrant to search his apartment for heroin. I took these photos. The special thing about this is that the lead officer (in plainclothes, who I had trouble photographing in the shade) had been caught at a protest wearing fake 'black bloc' attire, and he was videoed grabbing a photographer and they took the film from his camera. So, basically, this same police officer, by random chance, was the one who must have spent at least some time monitoring our house and deciding that the schizophrenic man who made the complaint was the sane one, and that our house looked like a drug dealer house. By the way, Dave was a big pot smoker, grateful dead fan, so he has a sketchy appearance.http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2002/05/04/1262021.phpAnother stalking tangent related to this house was that another housemate, named Chris, is a super-impressive investigative journalist. He was one of the first people to break the story of Yusuf Bey of Oakland, who was a religious leader in a branch of the black muslim church which adopted racist and nonmuslim practices. He got really loyal ex-prisoners to help run his corrupt business empire, and he also commited several counts of rape. During the rape trial, his sons and followers were stalking Chris. They threw bricks through the newspaper office windows, and he would see them try to follow him home. So he got scared and stayed in another county for a few months. Last year, the church members actually did bump off another big journalist, which finally brought more concern by the larger community, and Chris got on this higthly recommended clip on 60 Minuteshttp://www.eastbayexpress.com/news/read_our_2002_coverage_of_your_black_muslim_bakery/Content?oid=475609http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3870543nThe media are now covering all sorts of corruption in the Oakland police related to this. Earlier, they had let these 'black muslims (who are totally different from Malcom X style black muslims) unofficially keep order in their neighborhoods. Except they tended to be very violent. There is an Oakland officer who is essentially on their side and helped the likely shooter get an alibi http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/28/ED6613PILA.DTL

1178,0,"Largely only in the urban school districts(LA, NY, Oakland, Chicago, Boston, Miami, SF, SD, etc.). In a lot of suburban neighborhoods the teachers are fairly good to even great in most cases. In Orange County, CA most of the schools outside of Santa Ana are very good. I know one of the first kids to get a 2400 on the new SAT came from a public school in Orange County, CA. Irvine public schools have graduates who go to Ivy League schools every year. In Irvine and several other cities about as many graduates go to private universities as both state university systems combined and that is despite the fact that CA's UC system is compares favorably with a good number of private schools because a good number of kids get a good enough education that that they get accepted to private schools that are arguably better than the UC system.Even in some of the less wealthy parts of the OC, a lot of the kids are doing well. A lot of the Vietnamese immigrants in Westminster and Garden Grove go onto college and graduate unlike a lot of kids in urban schools.There are a few very rural places with bad teachers, but most of the schools with the teachers that are overpaid day care in urban districts.I am not to be racist, but some urban schools have ""dumb"" kids because the kids don't want to learn and their parents don't care. Parents that don't care come in every color of the rainbow, but they are more often Black or Latino. Bill Cosby got in a lot of heat over it, but until some of these parents change their attitudes nothing will change. They elect the tweedle dee and tweedle dumb to the school board election after election and instead of putting blame in the school boards ear they often blame it on not getting enough money (which is has a weak relationship with success) or racism(even when their schools get above average funding and the school board racially reflects the community) or any of an number of factors other than the fact that they show little interest in their kids education or in throwing the buffoons who run their local schools out the first chance they get. Worse, yet I remember there are some very well educated people who want to help, but are mistreated like this one Yale grad who taught at a troubled school for Teach for America and was falsely accused of corporal punishment. Some of these schools don't want help.The full story on the Yale grad:http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_1_how_i_joined.htmlWhile I agree that we should nuke a lot of urban school systems I think that a lot of suburban schools are serving most of their students well.

Fill their lawn with trash? Let their yard turn into a dead or tangled mess of weeds? What if your neighbor has a continuous tent city of people living on his lawn? Do you think these things would impact your ability to sell your home later?The only HOA I've lived with was in a small condo and they didn't cause trouble, but I don't in principle see anything wrong with the idea. After all, the people who set up the HOA own the property and they decided to incorporate all of it into an HOA -- that's their right. You are free to, knowing it has an HOA, not buy into it. I mean, people are free to do what they want with their property, right? The guy who bought the land all those houses sit on decided to divide it up with a HOA for oversight and sell properties with restrictions -- is that not his right? And people buying do so with the knowledge of the HOA...

Holy fuck are you morons deluded. Unlike Russia's tank-and-bullet expansionism, Western Expansionism is comprised of countries choosing to opt in. To imagine that Russia is the good guy is just moronic.>they are ready and willing to engage NATO if their interests are at stake.*Ha ha ha ha ha*They aren't engaging NATO, and there was no chance that this would lead to engaging NATO. Your chest thumping (you Russian? Every fucking Russian that emigrated away from their shithole, corrupt, drunken nation strangely feels some need to defend it at every chance) is laughable, and again points to extraordinary delusion. Russia is a puny little weakling now, and its great military conquests end in taking pot shots at a country of 4 million.

Imagine how much more upsetting it'd be if you were QuÃ©bÃ©cois.If you're exempt from this contest and do a badass CSS redesign and mssg me with it before the contest ends, I'll send you a bobblehead and some other reddit schwag. Team reddit reserves the right to determine whether a redesign is ""badass"" or not ;)

I agree with the post on ""brick weed"", as this stuff definitely is brick.I prefer vapo to smoke, but just cant afford a vape right now, but it might be worth the investment.Also, yes, there is a mental clarity that comes with the day AFTER, and it is hard not to see the world in a boring light, so I will give meditation a shot.Excercise can always help in any situation in regulating behaviorial hormones, and but I argue that not many potheads I know are active at all, and dont have this problem.

5163,0,"Granted, the guy isn't being as tolerant as he could (should) be, but I can't quite see why so many of you are sending him nasty harassing emails, either. For all we know, it could be a really expensive development where people expect the houses around them to be at a certain level of decency, and maybe the Jensen family has let the yard run totally wild--like imagine two-foot high weeds, unseeded dirt draining into the road and creating mud with every rainfall... and so on. The article doesn't say. But if that was the case, would Edwards's reaction really be so out of place? We don't have the whole story here, and yes, the title may be absolutely correct--but there's not any proof at all. In fact, the only things we know for certain are that Jensen signed up for the reserves, and moved into a neighborhood with an agreement he then broke. Oh, yes, and they also essentially abandoned their house for months--which doesn't really contribute to things like a low crime rate, property values, etc. People shouldn't sign up for the reserves unless they're willing to serve, and shouldn't move into a neighborhood with a strict HA agreement if they're going to let it fall by the wayside. The Jensens made their choices.

But anyway, some stupid hausfrau was trying to enforce some bullshit rules about the garden, I thought that was completly fictional with minimal resemblence to real life! How come people dont go amok with all the guns you americans are allowed to own. You are supposed to be the land of the free, not the land of tidy gardens.
