82,1,"""Although Jonathan Magbie died from causes currently under investigation, it is clear that his death was the result of the overly punitive laws criminalizing the use and possession of marijuana.""No. He died as a result of improper care in jail. The judge shouldn't have put him in jail, but prison officials were responsible for his death.I'm totally in favor of legalizing marijuana, but irrational statements like that one don't exactly help the legalization cause. Put down the pipe, stop dressing like a hippie, and convince people that you can smoke weed and contribute to society because the majority of the nation doesn't see you that way.

234,1,"Here's what's great about Paul's candidacy: I can't stand Penn for various reasons, but he and I agree on the principles that matter as far as government. Anyone who is sincerely a patriotic American and sincerely studies these issues comes to the realization that Paul is right on most of this stuff. When we support Paul we're saying we support the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Anyone who says they're for the drug war needs to explain when the American people authorized it. When the American people went screwy and passed the Amendment banning liquor they later came to their senses and passed an Amendment ending Prohibition. Now we live with drug Prohibition but there is no Amendment to rescind. Liberty was taken without a vote cast or a shot fired. And here in California we had a big vote that said medical marijuana was authorized and the feds asserted authority and said, ""We don't care what you've voted for because this is not a republic and it's not a democracy any longer."" I know this sounds a bit crazy, but everyone should really examine [Gonzales v. Raich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich) and see what's going on now in this country. And then you understand why so many supposedly unlikely people are uniting behind Ron Paul's candidacy. We're united in loving freedom. We want a limited federal government. We want the right to screw up. We want the freedom to say what we think even if it's not p.c.. We want to keep more of what we earn. We want a strong military, but not an unsustainable empire based on confused motives (we got rid of Saddam and he was a bad actor, but are we establishing a secular democracy in Iraq?).

362,0,"For a good read, check out [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Unequal-Protection-Corporate-Dominance-Rights/dp/1579549551/) from Thom Hartmann.**Book Description***Corporations rule the world, claims Thom Hartmann, and they are despoiling it for profit. He traces the historical friction between individual rights and the corporation, culminating in a landmark 1886 court case that altered the course of constitutional protection forever. Since then, corporations have steadily acquired power, enrolled the average citizen in a new kind of servitude, shifted an unfair share of the tax burden, taken control of the media, and co-opted the regulatory process for their own purposes. Hartmann cites examples of the absurd and frightening power: sterile streams and undrinkable water, poisonous neighborhoods, a government's willingness to drill for oil in untouched Alaskan wilderness when saving 2 miles per gallon per car would produce more oil in 2 years than in all of Alaska. To end the abuses, Hartmann calls for a grassroots revolution. He says it's time to understand the true costs of our consumerist society, take back the government, and shift to a values-based economy.*

368,1,"I do agree with you that the rich bitch shouldn't have been given an Abrahms tank of a car to drive or that she should be let off of charges because the other participant in the crash decided to flee the scene. But I think the point missing is that neither of them should have had a drop to drink(legal or otherwise) or a toke of pot for that matter. The injustice is that both of them aren't facing 21 years in prison(or life if it was my call). Driving an automobile is a privilege and not a right. Anytime you take the wheel you need to realize that other people's lives are in your hands and you should treat that situation with the utmost respect and face severe consequences when others die as a direct result of your own negligence. That's one of the many problems with my own country we call the U.S. of A: Nobody wants to take responsibility for their own actions.

You're absolutely right that Paul isn't going to win. So it does make sense to pick Obama as a better choice than Clinton for kinder and more sinsible president.Do you remember the Simpsons episode where the aliens are running for office? I view things like that currently. We started with some very interesting candidates like Kucinich and Paul. Yet somehow we ended up with Obama, Clinton and McCain. Wait a second, how did this happen?There is something greater at play here. I don't think people are really that evil has to dismiss a pullout from Iraq or a legalization of marijuana. So what happened to these guys? Some form of manipulation had to have occurred. Maybe it wasn't you that was manipulated, but more likely it was the huddled masses that never bothered to educate themselves on the issues.So if you support the guy that Kennedy is fawning over now, doesn't that make it a tiny bit suspicious? Suspicious that you're now the one being manipulated?

Maybe it was the caps. >i was checking reddit when i was 17 and living at home. what does it matter? It does tend to matter when talking about politics. The young tend to be more naive and idealistic, lacking the healthy skepticism that comes from watching one politician after another game the system, go back on campaign promises they never really intended to keep, or otherwise stab their supporters in the back. To be fair, there are plenty of more 'seasoned' people who are no better, or who have learned the wrong lessons from past political betrayal. >about bib4tuna's comment. i talk to my parents and brother about the negatives of hilary as well. I find it a goddamned shame that the election has come down to Obama vrs Clinton. With Kucinich out, and Paul likely soon to follow, Americans are left to choose a candidate based on who will be the least harmful to America. Obama clearly leads the field among the leading four: he may do some good, perhaps legalizing hemp/marijuana, while he dithers with a prolonged withdrawal (here's to hoping he won't pull a reversal on that one). All in all, 2008 will go doen as an opportunity lose for the US.

There are solid reasons to believe that punishments or threats do deter some of the law-abiding people who surround us. When the military instituted drug testing, they found that it did deter drug users from applying.

1217,0,"1997, taxi rank in the Brisbane suburb of New Farm, a group of five young aboriginal people decide to jump ahead of me. I tell them do not go thinking they are going to jump the queue and the s--- hits the fan, one foul mouthed slut gets in front another comes up on my right, another my rear and two, a man and a woman, cut me off from the left. From the right, “…look at this c--- , thinks he's white,” I am in fact part aboriginal, Tasmanian on my father’s side, Mother’s father was a mainland aboriginal from South Australia, her mother was from Scotland. The same vile woman screaming filth to my front, that’s the aboriginal tactic, she was to divert my attention while the others got bold enough to attack, there were only five most often it’s a lot more. My plan is to chop the one to the right, but grab the one behind me from over my head …the body language of the two at left indicates that they are just gonna watch, probably already going over in their minds that their legal team will mitigate them out of serious consequences after I am murdered, just then a police vehicle pulls up opposite they melt into the night. Any bets that these were from the same gang that murdered Mr Te Kooti. Nineties I go into a pub, there is an African chick behind the bar, I tell her that I am the only man that refused to be a scab on three union jobs, and that trade unionists had been murdered, and that a Sunday newspaper had labeled me a union grass after I went to the police regarding threats and the murder of union members. She turned on me in a big way I hear a voice say, …Strike one. I stop at the intersection while an African lady crosses the street a toothy twenty four carat smile …etc, she scowled… I head the same voice say, … Strikke two. On my way to the gym I had been taking the 9.30 am fitness class for a couple weeks, I was feeling good and kindly disposed, an African lady had been on the bus stop for a couple days running, I smile and by God she scowled, the same voice says, …Strikkke three, and Nigerians are out of my vision from that day to this. In a cross road situation for instance, they stay as black shapes in my peripheral vision, that way they all look the goddam same. The ones I see on TV and on the internet make me wanna puke. Just the same the African men I see nightly on the news in Africa, beating, hacking and killing, shapes my view of Africans more so than Hollywood. See black actors in these blockbusters… Boy Got New Shoes: … Black boy eighteen years or so hurrying thru evening shoppers clutching a pair of used sneakers, he had taken them from the body of a sleeping white man aged twenty one, he and his companion had attacked and killed, he was not charged his companion got two years, yeah his companion was black. Race Not Color: … Black youth fourteen years or so going thru prone motionless man’s pockets under city lights, fifteen black teenage tribesmen and girls attacked and battered to death Hoera Te Kooti aged sixty one, he was on his way home from the pub, one charged no conviction. He was of the sea faring Moldi people of New Zealand. Anybody who thinks that I am a racist should know that I am not, indeed many of my best girlfriends have been black, in matters of love a stiff prick is the best bridge between the races… That’s what I have found anyways. Black boy calls and wants to go bushwalking with two white teenagers, he bludgeons both to death nor did he see the inside of a courtroom… bleeding hearts describing his prior schizophrenia as cause …he is said to be free, the crime was in 2002. More on Christmas Day 2007, Western Australia …a group of five blacks attack and kill a white man playing sand lot cricket with his kids.

1279,1,"I'm glad you agree that smoking weed is a relevant fact. If you catch someone with a large number of drugs, they are either doing a shitload of drugs, or dealing. There are better places in a world of limited resources to direct that money. After all, this is an investment. Drugheads can twist logic as much as they want, people that do drugs aren't as effective, productive, or hardworking as people that don't.Whether or not that's true, that is the judgement of society, written into law. If you choose to circumvent the law, you must accept the consequences as an adult (alright, pseudo-extended-adolescent-teenager-adult for your typical college student).That means losing your financial aid, well, make the decision and live with it.

So do other countries, but one shouldn't try to frame general statements that apply to many different contexts in terms of a few specific cases and without qualification.The guy who posted the Prohibition of Alcohol link is a perfect example of this line of thinking. I asked him to prove his general statement about drug prohibition, and he posts an example about alcohol. Even if I were to accept it as a drug, what about the dozens of others? I don't think that anyone will reasonably equate alcohol, marijuana, heroin, and crack cocaine (for example).

1635,1,"I have had e-fucking-nough of idiotic politicians using cannabis as a political football. The only reason, the only reason, they want to tighten the laws is because they think a soft-on-drugs approach loses them votes. They do not care a jot about the health of the nation - if they did they legalise. All they care about is securing or holding on to power.The truth is that a soft-on-drugs approach might lose them some votes. They’ve told the public to be afraid of drugs and afraid we are. However, this is not a stand that should be continued, instead people should be taught to be afraid of prohibition and misinformation and vested interests benefiting to the cost of everyone else.Besides, it may actually bring them more votes than they’d lose. A while ago I ran a poll on my site and around 40% of 700 cannabis users who voted said they’d switch to the Tories if Cameron promised to decriminalise. This makes up a significant voting block – moreover, of voters who are currently disenfranchised from politics, don’t usually votes and can tip the balance in elections. So they might lose some votes from the very few people who will never change their mind on the subject. A great many more people might not like the policy but wouldn’t switch parties because of it. Many people who don’t like the idea could be persuaded when they are told of the overwhelming benefits. And a significant number of new people could be brought on board because this is exactly what they are looking for.I think changing the law on drugs could be a vote winner – unfortunately we don’t have anyone here who gets this, unlike Obama.

3062,1,"To be honest with you, I think pharma and chemical industries have something to gain. They can incorporate marijuana into some of their products, and/or sell organic extracted THC with other chemicals that negate the 'high' effects and/or enhance the powerful pain-killing, appetite-stimulating, and other medical effects. The chemical industry could use hemp or chemicals derived from it in their production lines. The tobacco industry - Marlboro greens are designed and their marketing campaign is probably ready to roll. Alcohol is a compliment in some cases. So no, I disagree that the industries are complete losers in this case. I do, however think, that their lobbying against marijuana can be considered anti-competitive behavior, an argument I hope to have the honor of bringing in court.

3652,1,"Race isn't a discrimination condition if two candidates are qualified. It's a bonus attribute because you now have a police officer who can better relate to your minority community which goes back to your original statement asking how to get rid of racist traditions.There is no fine line between harassment and enforcement because my third bullet is true. If you are a black man arrested by the police you are more likely to be convicted of a crime than a white man. It isn't a quota for convicting but because if inherent racism built into the system due to many factors including, but not limited to:* poverty of minority communities* leniency for first time offenders (which stacks due to a member of a minority community being more likely to be convicted of a crime, there is a greater chance of being convicted a second time.)* Lack of education* Lack of money to fund a proper defense.All of these things stack to the point where minorities are more likely to be convicted after being taken into custody compared to whites, regardless of actual guilt which leads to more future convictions. It's easier for a white person to get a deferred sentence or enter an alternative rehabilitation program.And stopping all violent cops won't happen because cops are not abusive to the powerful parts of a community, only the weak. If the mayors family kept getting arrested and tazed and charged for possession with intent to distrubte for carry a gram of weed things might change a little faster than when it's the son of a single mother making $19,000 a year.Your plan of just ignoring the racial issue doesn't solve racism because all of these hindrances already exist. Those of the minority community know it and it's awfully prescriptive to say ""We should just talk about reality as if racism wasn't there and things will change.""

3702,1,"Yes, yes it is.Remember the alcohol ban? Now that was just hilarious shit.""Prohibition destroyed the manufacturing and distributive agencies through which the demand for liquor had been legally supplied. But the demand remained"" (Hu, 1950: 51)This is in part what we're doing. But instead of destroying an industry, we're stalling it. The important part here is ""But the _demand_ remained""When philly says that the law is a good law if only the majority of people accept and respect it, he's right. When the alcohol ban started, the majority of people just went on drinking. Producing home made alcohol and acquiring it through the black market, thus involving crime groups like the mafia and any other.Beer was put on the same level as heroin. Which is what we're doing with pot right now, and that's wrong.So YES, we need people to stand up and stop being _sheeples_. Fucking society of sheep makes me sick.

4067,1,"And it's a good point. If you base your legalization argument on the lack of success of prohibition, the prohibition people can just say ""Well, let's try harder!""Harm reduction is the main criterion behind any law. Prohibition of marijuana does more harm than good, therefore it should be ended.Prohibition of (non-state) murder does more good than harm. It's easy to see that legalizing murder would result in immense suffering, so murder should remain prohibited.The problem is with people who think laws are based on morals, and that things are illegal because they are immoral. Those are the ones who really do equate murder with pot smoking, because they believe pot smoking is illegal because it is immoral, just as murder is apparently illegal because it is immoral.But even though most people think murder is immoral, that's not why it's illegal.If people could look at it dispassionately, they'd see that even from a moralistic point of view prohibition of pot should be ended, because it makes more harm than good, it causes far more suffering than legalization would.

Some of the best weed I've smoked has been in a third world country too! The problem isn't the geographical location of where it's grown, believe it or not, a plant grown in a tropical climate compared to the states would fair much better and produce a more quality crop. The problem lies in the fact that most exporters and bulk growers grow for speed and weight, they don't grow for quality. The weed on the illegal market is primarily made by organised criminals, with business not pleasure on their minds. Another factor affecting the quality is; a lot of the weed that you get from overseas is packed away for very long amounts of time where the weed becomes dry, brittle and loses it's freshness and flavour. You get this same problem with weed grown domestically in the states, if it's grown by a gangster, you better believe that the quality is going to be absolutely shit! If it's grown by someone who knows what they are doing and who flushes and cures the plant properly, you will have a quality smoke.

5445,1,"You're right on that. Conviction percentages aren't an indication of criminality.Here are some better examples:""African Americans report being in a physical fight at a similar rate (36.5%, versus 32.5% for whites), but were arrested for aggravated assault at a rate nearly three times that of whites (137 per 100,000, versus 48 per 100,000).""in 2001 whites and African Americans reported similar rates of carrying a weapon (whites 17.9%, African Americans 15.2%), and similar rates of carrying a gun (whites 5.5%, and African Americans, 6.5%). African American youth represent 32% of all weapons arrests, and were arrested for weapons offenses at a rate twice that of whites (69 per 100,000, versus 30 per 100,000).According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among youths aged 12 to 17, the rate of current illicit drug use was 11.1 % among whites, and 9.3% among African Americans. In a previous year, the same survey found that white youth aged 12 to17 are more than a third more likely to have sold drugs than African American youth. The Monitoring the Future Survey of high school seniors shows that white students annually use cocaine at 4.6 times the rate of African Americans students, use crack cocaine at 1.5 times the rate of African Americans students, and use heroin at the same rate of African Americans students, and that white youth report annual use of marijuana at a rate 46% higher than African American youth. However African American youth are arrested for drug offenses at about twice the rate (African American 314 per 100,000, white 175 per 100,000) times that of whites, and African American youth represent nearly half (48%) of all the youth incarcerated for a drug offense in the juvenile justice system. So at least in the areas of Drugs, Weapons and Assaults, whites display more criminality, not less, and yet are arrested and convicted at a lower rate. Of course you might argue that people are lying about their rates of criminality on anonymous surveys, and the data sets aren't homogeneous, but it's certainly a relatively interesting set of data that questions the validity of using race as a profiling measure.EDIT:[ Justice Policy Institute has a bunch of papers on racial disparity in our justice system](http://www.justicepolicy.org/content.php?hmID=1811&smID=1582&ssmID=34)

They hold the rights to the refinement processes used in those big stinky pulp plants.Cannabis would be a nice bump of cash, but hemp fiber is superior to wood pulp as a source of durable cellulitic fiber. Not only does it out perform wood-pulp and cotton, but its a far higher yield per acre than cotton, requires 5% of the pestacides to acieve max yeild as compared to cotton. It also produces a yeild that is 100x more compact, as compared acre by acre to wood farming (which includes some clearcutting of old growth).I worked really hard to get that into a somewhat easy to read paragraph... still too wordy.

5983,1,"I really don't understand what you mean. I did give that thought. drez24 was arguing that it will be difficult to convince people to support the end of the drug war because it employs and profits so very many people. He didn't precisely say that at all, but I understood it entirely and responded in kind. What do you think that I did wrong? What he is arguing is a completely illegitimate and irrelevant point. In a discussion over whether prohibition is morally or legally right or wrong, the idea of being able to get other people to believe you is completely irrelevant. I don't believe that I misunderstood drez24 in the slightest. He was advocating a very, very common viewpoint which is critically flawed. He was arguing that so many people profit from the drug war, that it will be difficult to stop. That is true. It is also as irrelevant as what brand doorknobs the president of Poland prefers when you're discussing the moral or legal rectitude of the drug war.>Case in point: the word 'regulate' has been used by you to describe prohibition. I pointed out the word 'regulate' could be used to describe something appropriate, as in the more appropriate things the FDA does. There's nuance to the semantics of the word 'regulate' that you did not leave room for in your otherwise ""competent and accurate"" OP.Yes, regulate can mean anything from complete banning to ensuring that a product is what it says it is. The common position put forth by millions of people in favor of regulation is that marijuana should be regulated as tobacco and alcohol is, not as pudding is. Were you actually advocating regulating it as pudding? because that is an extremely rare opinion, and it would benefit you greatly in the future to further explain what you mean. As you say, the word ""regulate"" as nuance and you cannot assume that people will choose to insert the definition that is most pleasing to them personally.Is that what you are suggesting? That when I read a post, I should go through and assume that they don't mean what they say or what people who provide the same viewpoint always mean, I should assume that they mean the thing that most agrees with me? That does sound like how a lot of people operate, especially in the political arena. Usually, though, they only do it to the people they 'like' and do the opposite for the people they don't. I try to remain objective, and not put words in peoples mouths when I can. I do fail, but I apologize and retract remarks and the like if that happens. But for instance, I don't believe I misunderstood the word ""regulate"" even a little bit. You meant it in terms of how alcohol and tobacco are regulated. In that sense of the term, it is morally indefensible. In terms of how they regulate pudding, it is certainly defensible.

That is not argument for leglization of theft any more than your argument that other people profit from the illegal and immoral prohibition of drugs is an argument in favor of our current situation.You have taken drez24 the wrong way - drez24 was not making an argument in favor of our current situation. And in the case of my original response to you, you responded to your own ideas about what positions I might possibly be advocating. I wasn't pushing my opinion about how it should be regulated. All I said was that regulation, the generalized concept, should not be the object of your impassioned cry. Now that it is abundantly clear it was not, I don't have much of an agenda.But to be clear, I believe marijuana is safer than most over-the-counter drugs, much safer than alcohol or tobacco, and should be regulated closer to pudding than most people think.

6412,0,"It does not bother me at all. I think the prefatory clause is essential to understanding the intent. ""Delinking"" clauses of an amendment that is one sentence long would be absurd. So lets go through it. “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. ““Regulated” means trained, it was common parlance of the day and would not have been understood to be in any way akin to ‘restricted.’ Militia means you, me and all free citizens of the country. “Security of a free State” means war against any who would seek to invade and the peace that comes from enemies not being willing to risk an invasion. “The People” means everyone individually. It is used in this sense several times in the constitution including the first, fourth, and ninth amendments. “Keep” means to poses. “Bear” means to carry at the ready. “Arms” means guns, bladed weapons and body armor worn by infantry. In the parlance of the day this was considered distinct from large crew serviced weapons like mortars and cannons which would be termed Artillery. I hope I don’t have to explain “shall not be infringed.”Put all that together. I read that citizens need to be trained for war or our country is vulnerable to attack, so every citizen has the right to infantry class military hardware which the government should not ever attempt to restrict. This seems like exactly the sentiment of men who fought a war against a monarchy so they could determine their own fates. As recently as World War 2 this principal prevented the invasion America by the Japanese. Admiral Yamamoto famously stated that, “You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.” There may be rational arguments for restricting gun ownership. I’ve never heard one but they might exist. I do know that there is no constitutionally sound defense of such restrictions. If you want to make gun ownership criminal you need to change the constitution. Go read article five, it will tell

However, thanks to the trickery of paycheck deductions, it escapes the notice of most people. I just want to flip that trickery on its head - instead of payroll deductions serving the needs of the Fed (lowering awareness of how much people pay in federal income tax), I want to cancel it to serve the needs of the people (being painfully aware of what they pay to the government). If people don't have enough to pay their taxes, maybe part of the reason is that taxes are too high? When revenues run low because the middle class is balking, maybe Congress will pay more attention to improving their lot? When one in ten inmates in federal prison is there for tax evasion instead of owning pot, maybe we'll see some *real* change in the government.

You're lungs probably aren't used to smoke. Take gentle hits. If you feel you're going to cough, stop taking the hit and continue taking a deep breath to get that smoke all the way in... hold it. 4. Have some eye drops with you. Regular visine, not any special kind, not the green kind, you want regular visine. 5. If you're offered a cigarette, decline. Many people get addicted to cigarettes while smoking high or drunk.6. Remember weed can't hurt you. If you start freaking out, stop. You're fine. 7. Remember weed is illegal.

7348,1,"You're right. So here's some information from an experienced voice of reason (me), that he likely won't hear elsewhere in the marijuana subreddit (or culture, ftm): #1 - MARIJUANA IS VERY ADDICTIVE IF YOU LIKE IT A LOT. ""Withdrawal symptoms"" are, for most, very mild, a non-issue. Cannabis is really only psychologically addicting. However, it's a versatile party-in-a-bag. If Haagen-Daaz ice-cream was half as much fun as weed, I'd surely be grossly obese with congealed butter-fat for blood by now. It's hard to say no... #2 - MARIJUANA IS OFTEN A 'GATEWAY' DRUG. This can be true for 2 reasons-- One, because it's illegal, the entire culture is connected to all illegal drugs; (conversation about and availability of other drugs is more likely), and-- Two, once you realize how much fun and relatively little harm can be had from toking up, you'll be much more curious about those ""other drugs"" the government's been keeping under wraps. Peer pressure from a social stoner-club to try other drugs can be great. #3 - MARIJUANA IS EXPENSIVE If I had to guess how much money I've spent in the last decade, it would prolly total 5 digits. I'm too embarrassed to tell you the first one. I enjoy weed, I really do... but I'm glad I waited until I was eighteen to try it, and I daresay I would have gotten a lot more accomplished in college if I had waited longer. After I started smoking, my social group went from over-achieving preppies to tired-eyed stoners. Nice enough people to hang out with, but they didn't push me to succeed. And most of them didn't go very far themselves, unless you count ""McDonald's Shift Supervisor"" as success. Food for thought.

So it's just a lost expense to the state. But rich little college students would get nabbed up real quick because they have money to spend on bail.So that could happen.

Well, marijuana ISNT unhealthy. The tobacco taxes are in place to stop people from using tobacco. We don't need that for marijuana. The taxes on alcohol are to help pay for the massive damage alcohol does to our society on a daily basis. We won't need any of that for marijuana. There simply isn't any rational justification at all.

8224,1,"Wow. The response on Obama's website is 100% consistent with his statements prior to the election and in his campaign materials... and everyone acts shocked. Obama has never been in favor of legalizing marijuana. He's never so much as hinted that he was. If you expected any other answer to that particular question, then that is *your* problem, not his. Seriously, I just don't understand people around here sometimes.

8266,1,"i dont think the majority of Obama supporters voted on the belief he would ""reform pot laws"". (There were much bigger reasons to vote for Obama) Anyone who believes that Obama will take office and magically overnight everything will change for the better - will be sorely disappointed. (and i say that as a passionate Obama supporter - we have to be pragmatic) These types of issues cant be fixed as if you were running a sprint. You have to look at it like a marathon and keep putting effort into it ever day consistently and without backing down - that is a much better recipe for success.
