8968,1,"You've got to put yourself in her shoes to understand. I know it's tough to think about but she comes from a generation that didn't have Internet like we do. If someone with authority told her that smoking weed is just as bad as heroin she'll tend to just believe it. Back in the day you just believed whatever fact was thrown at you because you couldn't google it. Now everyone is full of shit until its googled. She doesn't trust you so anything you say isn't going to convince her. You need to prove to her that you've done your research and you made an educated decision based off of facts. Showing her the union is a start but you need to back it up with actual scientific data. You guys need to have an open line of communication as well where you hear her concerns and you're able to voice yours. Once she starts to become too defensive cut the conversation off until it cools down then calmly try again until she sees what you're trying to present. Another issue is the legality of it all most parents don't want to bring criminal activity into their home. To us it's the risk we take but no good parent wants their child in jail. Good luck brother and fight the good fight, convincing your mum is one thing convincing the rest of the world is next.
"
17035,1,"I apologize if I wasn't clear. Let me try again.In order for the government to profit from legalization - e.g. from collecting taxes on marijuana sales - they have to make sure that legal marijuana is cheap and high-quality, so people will choose to buy legally (and pay taxes) instead of sticking with black market (and untaxed) dealers. Every sale in the black market is money lost to the government. Illegal dealers don't pay income tax, sales tax, payroll tax, etc - and people who are used to buying from dealers may continue to do so, as long as they don't have a good reason (lower prices! higher quality! convenience!) to buy legally.In other words, the government won't be growing marijuana - at least, I assume they won't be - but they still need to keep prices low and quality high in order to profit from the legalization of marijuana. Consider, in Canada, the case of tobacco taxes. In Ontario, maybe two or three decades ago, the government flirted with even higher taxes than today (note: my memory may be shoddy about actual facts here). What happened was that a lot of ordinary Ontarians began buying their cigarettes from smugglers (including one famous case of a native band whose reservation spanned the border with the U.S.), and the government's tax revenue went down, even though they had just raised taxes. Hence, in order to make more money off cigarettes, they lowered the price of cigarettes in Ontario.

18566,1,"I tend to agree with a lot of libertarian principles, but privatizing prison construction seems like a bad idea. Companies like to grow, and a private prison organization would likely find reasons to put more people in jail so they can justify more contracts. It's the standard argument against them, and you're probably familiar with it, but I think it outweighs any argument in favor of the inmates' safety (and an inmate in for something marijuana possession is far safer if he's not an inmate)Also, as Toots_o_Sunshine points out, I think they tend to be understaffed. Based on the quick bit of research I've done (mostly just [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison)), there seems to be a lot of legislation aiming to either banning them or providing more oversight, and a lot of the criticism seems to address existing problems. Obviously more research into actual incidents would be good, but it seems like a bad idea.

22065,1,"That's right, but once the decision is made to end criminal prosecutions, the government could choose to simply get out of the way entirely. My concern is that marijuana will end up in the same bungled situation in which alcohol remains, well after the ""end"" of Prohibition. In almost every province, one is still restricted to purchasing most alcohol at government stores, and with massive taxes levied on said purchases. Even transporting alcohol across provincial lines puts one in potential [peril at the hands of the local tax collectors](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/01/28/nb-liquor-laws-importing-618.html).

30354,1,"moving edit to the top: also, i was defending marijuana up there. in my original post i even said that heroin is very dangerous and should remain banned. you didnt even care about the points i was making. but anyway, you know exactly what it means your highness but ill explain it to you like a 5 year old child i guess, ,because you didn't like the way i phrased my point. (keyword: phrase)because my decision to shoot up heroin will affect me and the ones i love because they love me. of course. my entire immediate circle. i never said that wasnt true but because, like i said, you decided to take advantage of the way i phrased my point, i'll keep going. my decision to shoot up 20 children in an elementary school has effects that reach far out of my personal circle and involves people that are completely unrelated to me. as well as my own family and friends afterwards, and all of the families and friends of all the fucking people i'm able to spray any bullet at. in fact, unless you already have 20 children and decide to start heroin, it would be pretty tough to affect that many kids at once by starting to use drugs personally, let alone that it would take a while to develop the actual addiction. however a brief stint at a shopping mall with an ar-15 has instant and dramatic effects. they are uncomparable.tl;dr the way heroin affects people around you, and the way an ar-15 affect the people around you, are completely incomparable and i wont talk about it further because i actually believe you knew this is what i meant the whole time, and i feel ridiculous for obliging you right now.

32823,1,"Possibly. When you criminalize something, you allow criminals to control it. Drug dealers don't card you, because they don't care how old you are. On the other hand, if weed is legalized, many dealers will ""go out of business,"" because dispensaries can sell better product at lower prices. There may be shady people that take to the new niche market of selling to underage kids, but as with alcohol, this will come with hefty penalties if caught.

33398,1,"He, in hindsight, clearly intended to push a soft public message with carefully chosen words. This represents a cave on his previous statements from that long-lost figure known as Senator Barack Obama, particularly with respect to medical marijuana. However, he also had the mindset that the war on drugs was a failed one, and that it needed to end.And again, no, he does not have to enforce it, as was made clear by not defending in court the DOMA. There's plenty of precedence throughout history for an administration telling the DoJ to spend its resources one way or another because the DoJ is part of the executive.EDIT: Just realized it might have sounded weird that I mentioned ""again"", should have qualified that it was in another comment in this discussion where I first mentioned the DoJ/Executive control thing.

40160,1,"That's not what I asked and I'm not interested in that kind of discussion. I want to know what *you* think of Y-chromosomal Adam, as well as what you think about of concepts like most recent common ancestors. I'm asking you, I don't want to know what Christianity says it accepts. I'm looking for a bit more of a personal POV. I've already heard that Christianity accepts evolution, that is not new information to me. What I want to know now is what Christians actually think of these concepts, because many people from all walks of life would be happy to talk at length about how it makes the feel. But I've never met a Christian who wants to actually talk about it, talk about how it made them feel. All I ever knew was Christians growing up and I got in a boatload of trouble for talking about evolution. I'd never heard of atheism or even knew it was a thing, I was just obsessed with evolution as a child, and in all of the churches my parents went to I always got in trouble for it. I was always an outcast. It was a source of great depression to me, that I even turned to drugs as a teen (I thought I was some kind of criminal lowlife, but it was only smoking a bit of pot which is practically normalised these days).But yeah, I just thought I could finally ask a Christian, honestly, how thinking of evolution and specific amazing concepts like this makes them feel. Stating that Christianity accepts evolution is not a feeling. No one has ever read something about evolution and stopped mid way and thought ""wow, Christianity accept evolution"".Most people want to talk about how they feel about things. But I guess I can see why I was such an outcast. You know, it just occurred to me that maybe the reason my parents always punished me for being obsessed with evolution was not necessarily because they didn't believe in it, but maybe to protect me from our society. I just had a ""woah"" moment. Thanks for the talk, same time next week? Sorry, it's so weird talking about this kind of thing. I keep expecting that feeling of dread of my dad finding out I spent the night at the library reading books on evolution, like I need to look over my shoulder to keep from getting caught.

Please tell me why we should bother to engage a post that implies that most american women are whores. >you've presumed that social being and ultimately mode of production are not what determine ""self-expression"" and especially art. Where did I do that? >Tribal societies, which are characterized by a primitive communism, have almost identical aesthetics in art, clothing, religion, and mythology. I think you need to seriously work on your eurocentrism and anthropological reading. > Modern society is characterized by a highly fluid, materialistic, and reactionary (compared to say, Maoist China as that guy you banned rightly points out) fashion Fashion is indeed highly fluid. BolCHEvik also posted a good link to show how the soviets were great practitioners of nudism. But please tell me how you find current fashion unambiguously ""reactionary"" in non-moralistic terms - and let me know when that serves as an argument to denounce american women as ""whores"".> Anyone who thinks they can escape the influence of Capital by flashing their breasts in public (like the SlutWalk) or wearing hemp clothes is an idiot at best. Ableism aside, at no point did we endorse liberal feminism, and in the OP the precise point we made is that there is no way to ""escape"" current society, if you bothered to read, which it seems you didn't. Anyway I am sure you know better than the majority of liberal feminists when you justify the practice of ""slut-shaming"". Tell me more how this is a great tactic for the feminist movement. >Second, you presume that different societies with different modes of production are comparable, a disturbing idea for a Marxist. It is worth pointing out, when one is essentializing and naturalizing the status of a certain item as ""slutty"", ""less than human"", etc, that this is merely the predominant ideology of the current mode of production, and also one of the pillars of settlerist ideology. If we should indeed assume that less clothing is less than human, do we justify rape? Do we justify the way the settlers handled the natives of the lands they colonized? But really what you wrote is just a platitude. > In our society, clothing is completely determined by value since all things are determined by the production of surplus value. Economist reductionist. You completely ignore all analysis of the superstructure. This is very disturbing for a marxist. >Anyone who does not see that patriarchy (and of course men) are the bearers of social and economic power, and therefore determine fashion, what women wear, and what women think, is not a student of Marxism. You will note that we did not imply at any point that the choices women make are not informed by the world around them. The problem is that you are using this in order to denounce women. You are so concerned with orthodoxy you fail to see the consequences of the way you present your ideology. >""The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force"" is not an insult, it is simply something which is. Ok, so what does this monologue have to do with it? Are you saying that denouncing women as ""sluts"" because of the clothing they wear is the same as admitting that they are influenced by ruling class ideology? This is ridiculous, sorry. >1 sentence dismissals and the dude was banned is very disturbing. **No, sorry, you are defending a ""dude"" that is saying that less clothing ""makes rape easier"" and that american women are whores while trying to sound grandiose about tangents. I think this is disturbing.**

And no doubt this also touches on the Drug War, another huge waste of taxpayer money.Someone very close to me was on welfare. She has always described it as too little money and more trouble than it was worth. The stigma was not the issue AT ALL. It was a survival tactic on her part after her roommates screwed her over with several bills in an apartment she couldn't afford.I don't fault anyone for doing what they need to do to survive. But I don't think welfare is a good system. And, what you're proposing has the intent of helping, but would have the opposite long-term effect. You're not seeing the down-the-road consequences of handing out millions of taxpayer dollars.""Your premise here really doesn't make sense, especially considering that it is coming from someone who very much seems to look down on unproductive members of society. The social stigma already exists in you.""I personally don't have a problem with someone that wants to sit in their apartment all day and smoke pot and play video games. As long as you're not hurting anyone, I don't care what you do. I just have a problem with paying for someone else's lifestyle, whether its productive or not.""I've personally never known anyone who just contentedly sits around and collects welfare.""Well, then you've probably never known a drug addict.""Like when they are receiving a BI? If the generous in this country weren't so occupied with feeding the hungry and housing the homeless, there'd be more money for them to spend on other causes.""Except that you're taking tax money away from people through force to pay for this insane program. There will be no ""extra"" money because of the cost involved in collection and distribution.""The food-stamps program came about because 60-Minutes or Frontline or one of those news magazines did a special report on the fact that poor southerners were literally starving.""I'm not sure you know history, but here's [the Wikipedia entry about food stamps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program). People were not starving in the streets. People in the South at that time could still hunt a squirrel or find subsistence somewhere. When people die of starvation in the street THAT'S starvation. As the saying goes, hungry people don't stay hungry for long.""worked fantastically"" The only way you can make that phrase work is by invoking piles of starved bodies without the government's help. That would not have happened. The US is one of the most plentiful nations on the planet. Our cup runneth over with food resources. Why didn't people starve in the 20's? or the 30's? They didn't have welfare then. Where are the pictures of all the starving people from the late 1880's? Where is the historic record of cowboys starving or colonists? Starvation is an incredibly rare thing in the US. This isn't a desert.""Libertarians believe in individual freedom, or self determination. This is not a concept that is limited only to coercion by government.""Libertarians don't believe in government coercion. Sorry.

Last time I checked, no one was forced to have kids or raise them here. And again, you blame capitalism, but it's the government that makes public school mandatory. Government sends the DYFS goons to tell you how to raise your kids if you're not on board with ""the system"", not capitalism. You're only in the capitalism game if you want your kids to have cool clothes and Xbox and Internet. You can raise them in the bush in Kenya for all I care. I just don't want to PAY for your kids.In a free market, people are forced to behave according to their means. With BI, have all the kids you WANT! Don't worry, the government will supply everything. Food, shelter, healthcare, education--- Why even raise them? You're not responsible. What a terrible system you're proposing. Where the Heck did you learn all this?""There is no choice in, ""quit this job and starve, or continue working and eat."" In a scenario like this, self-determination is impossible.""Uh, yeah, there is a choice. That you don't see it is very, very sad.""That's what a democratic government is!""No, young Skywalker, it is not. The deck is stacked and the vote is rigged. But someone that worships government like yourself cannot see the forests for the trees. On the one hand, you say the capitalist system is a system of slavery, but on the other hand you say, well if you don't like America, get lost. That's a very dangerous proposition these days considering the behavior of the American Empire and its current leader. Make up your mind. All we all slaves, unable to leave or are we all free to leave? If we're free to move to Somalia to be blown up by a drone, are we not free to change careers or start a business anymore?My suggestion to you is that you should immediately start your own business. It would be quite an educational experience for you. We'll see how you react to the reams of government regulation and taxes. How will you fare when one of your employees cries poor and you catch him again and again goofing off at work or even stealing from you? I'll be your tune will suddenly change then. You're very generous with other people's money. I wonder how generous you'll be when it's your own on the line.

Furthermore, if they're that depended then they'll just drink and accept the punishment later.> im not punishing solely pot heads, even if you dont smoke pot if you break the same laws you still cant smoke pot until the amount of time is up, im not targeting pot heads i just think marijuana should be a privilege you're making unnecessary correlations that just dont work in the real worldCome on. You're adding a needless extra condition to the law, one that doesn't serve any purpose but to give one group of people an extra incentive not to do something. It's not that complicated. Arguing that this isn't punishing pot heads would be like arguing that it is ok for judges to start banning people from gay bars if they speed. After all, no one is allowed to go, the fact that straight men don't want to go to the gay bar doesn't mean that you're punishing gay men (sarcasm).> im not going to sit here and explain the difference between a sports game and marijuana like youre a fucking childSo in other words you've refused to defend your claim and instead showed a general ignorance of the fallacy. I'm not claiming that they are the same thing, I'm claiming that the too actions are equivalent in this subject matter.

98797,1,"yeah, exactly, which is why I hate people who preach that pot isn't addictive, as opposed to physically addictive. I want pot to be legal, it does a lot of good.

Many mental addictions are based on the prep, and the anticipation, which you get mighty right from packing a bowl.So if your going to counter an addicted to pot argument, use something more intelligent and less sarcastic than>TIL you can get addicted to potI don't care if you're talking to an idiot/sarcastic asshole.

99049,1,"There are a bunch of pulp and paper companies who want this to happen. They know that it would be vastly cheaper to cultivate with much higher production yields, which means they'd stand to make serious money. Out here in the PacNW, a place well known for it's social tolerance of pot (Washington legalized it, Oregon has it decriminalized and the only reason it didn't get legalized in the last election was that the measure was VERY badly written) there are a ton of lumber companies that are quietly doing studies on what it would take to swap over some of their properties into industrial hemp production.

"
103893,1,"I would estimate pot usage to increase 50-300% as a result of legalization. This would reflect the increases in usage after legalizing other drugs (alcohol, opium, etc) although not pot itself, since legalizing pot has never really been done before. Which is why I have such a vague guess, 50-300%. Decriminalization, comparatively, risks a lot less when it comes to increased usage.Despite this, it is not likely pot usage will outscale tobacco usage outside of specific markets in the forseeable future, 850+ million people use tobacco.Still in favor of ilegalization though. I think the end of the drug war, and the increased liberty to people that do choose to use pot, is worth the cost of more users. Alcohol and tobacco usage are STILL going to be more popular then pot usage (as a whole), and they both have more potential for abuse. Pot is also easier to grow then tobacco, and easier to smuggle then both. I think if we decide as a society that the increase in liberty from letting people make their own choices is worth it for those two drugs, we should extend the same logic to pot, as the logic is MORE true for pot then it is for those other two drugs.On the other hand. once I started to realize just HOW MUCH usage would probably increase I became more in favor of decriminalization standpoints which is a sort of ""best of both worlds"" approach in that it avoids costly police work, while keeping an increase in usage very low or non-existant. Decriminalization is better then the system we have now in pretty much every way, and it's a no-brainer, although I'm not sure if it's better then legalization.My proposition is that pot is decriminalized everywhere, put onto schedule 2, and individual countries/states/whatever that want to try legalization can. But there should be a sunset provision, after say 5 years, where the law would be reviewed and people would have to ask themselves if things were moving in the right direction.
"
105415,1,"I like to have variety. Generally having two plants is no worse than having one from a legal standpoint and cuts down the amount of veg time you need to get a certain amount of product. That said after a grow or two you should have way more pot than you know what to do with so you'll have a lot of variety after a few runs.I would suggest having a separate area you can use for keeping mothers of strains you like. It doesn't need to be large, I use an 18gal tub that I lined with mylar and put two PC fans in that currently has 2 23W CFLs in it because I'm trying to keep plants slow because I'm not putting anything into flower in the summer after the current crop finishes.
"
106948,1,"It's not even about changing your mind as it is about becoming more realistic about the president. I thought the hero-worship of Obama was cringe-worthy, and as someone who has seen many elections and numerous presidents come and go, they are all pretty much the same at a certain level, and there is nothing that any of us can do about it. It is at another level that voting makes a difference. Under Obama, this country finally legislated some sort of national health care. It needs work and it will evolve, but it got started. Also under Obama we saw the legalization of marijuana in a couple of states, a crack in the wall that should have come many years ago. We are also seeing same-sex marriage become a reality. None of this would have happened under a Republican president. People just have to be realistic about what they expect from their president, and don't treat him as some sort of deity. If they fulfill half of their campaign promises then that should be considered a decent presidency. I just expect them to not screw up the entire nation and/or world, which is what Bush did. On balance, Obama has done a pretty good job. I never expected perfection from him.BTW, all this NSA hullabaloo is nonsense. We've all known this was happening all along. Before the internet they were listening in on our phone calls and reading our mail. Today they are logging our searches and storing our email. Now that someone comes along and confirms it everyone is going apeshit, but we shouldn't really be surprised. We also shouldn't be surprised that Obama is going along with it. The NSA was there before him, and the NSA will be there after him. To them, he's just a passing cloud.

Pretty close for an unsourced statistic on the internet really. www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/high-school-youth-trendsaSo only over 1/3rd of 12th grade Americans can have their illegal weed smoking used to convict them of any theoretical crime. Bring in illegal downloads, undeclared income, insurance application irregularities and community bylaw infractions and pretty much any kid is already committing enough crime to be convicted whenever we like. Some may use weed smoking as evidence that a person fits the profile of a criminal, I use the governments position that smoking weed can be used as evidence of criminal behavior as evidence of THAT governments criminal behavior. Pharmacological evidence has failed to prove time and again that marijuana causes criminal behavior but has succeeded in proving that it is a good candidate as a medication for that exact problem, but it's not advantageous to bring that up. So lets just confuse causation and correlation just long enough to link pot smoking and criminal activity... but not alchohol and criminal activity... or playing dice and criminal activity... or geographic location and criminal activity ect.

121892,1,"Well if you legalize marijuana you're basically legalizing hemp too since they come from Cannabis Sativa L.

124121,1,"I see it as a democratic issue and as a justice issue. Without information transparency, how can we know that the decisions our elected leaders are making are responsible and in our best interest? Just like in the scientific method, I want the conclusions a Representative comes to to be based on a repeatable, logical process - not to be the result of hidden data or back room dealings. For instance, why should we be putting people away for pot if we don't know it's quantitative and clinical safety profile? The reasoning behind the law, and thus the data needs to be public.I think Capitol Bells could be a new method for implementing democracy, and it's not limited to the US Congress. The same formula of getting the alert an elected body is voting, and virtually voting just ahead of them could work just as well at the state and local level, as well as in other democratic nations. It enables us to publicly (but anonymously) record our positions at a granular, local level. That in turn creates a performance metric to compare any individual Representatives official actions to, which could bite him in the ass when the next election rolls around.

137746,1,"> It's not just that 12% of the population break the law, it's that 12% are breaking the law at any given time.Considering some of the laws we have out there, that's not necessarily saying much. You could be breaking the law by carrying a multi-tool with a knife blade that's a centimeter too long. There's also a good chance that a large number of those ""law-breakers"" are marijuana offenses, which is obviously not the same as a hardened criminal on probation getting caught with the gun they were about to use to rob a liquor store, or something. It's just that they don't say ""12% of people were carrying some pot"" because that's not something that scares people into letting them get away with randomly searching whomever they feel like searching.Without knowing all of the specific offenses they're talking about, just saying ""12% of people are breaking the law at any given time"" doesn't necessarily mean you should worry.

Then why do I care? If you want to argue that they're hurting themselves that's fine -- but you'd still be wrong. Smoking pot is less harmful than drinking or smoking tobacco. And while we're on the topic of criminal behavior I'll ask what's worse: Someone who works a full shift at a hard job who wants to relax by toking up at a friends house afterwards? Or the state who deems that person a danger to society and locks them in prison for years because of manditory minimum sentencing?

"
152880,1,"No doubt; if you apply the 'personal freedom' argument to it, which I didn't touch on, then it would be more difficult to make the case to outlaw tobacco. But I think it's still quite achievable - we can already demonstrate an externality (second hand smoking) and as we know, your right to swing your fist ends at my nose. I think there would still be people that use it as a drug, but I doubt it would be at a level similear to that of marijuana now. The actual effects of tobacco are very mild compared to marijuana, and when contrasted with the negative effects tobacco usage is a far poorer drug of choice. We currently use caffeine, which can have similar mild stimulant effects, with far fewer health risks. Most smokers I know smoke because they started as young teens (peer pressure) or they were raised in smoking homes. The latter effect is almost eliminated now and will almost surely be near 0 in the next decade or two. The former will continue to be stamped out with education and better enforcement (I personally believe that possession of tobacco products should be illegal for those under the age of 19, but enforcement costs may be too high to effectively institute that). In a hypothetical future society where tobacco is not present I doubt there would be much demand for it, the current demand is based almost entirely off social/psychological pressures and not the actual effects of the drug.

She probably hasn't ever seen a joint before, let alone had someone offer one to her. She would have been confused. Adults probably would have had a similar experience during their lifetimes, so a teacher would be a decent person to talk to.What the teacher says to Jenny depends entirely on their own life experiences. Someone with some objectivity and decent life experience would probably say the girl on the bench shouldn't be offering drugs to anyone who walks by, and then educate on the uses and potential risks of marijuana, just as they would teach about alcohol.mSomeone with limited life experience and more conservative perspectives would be more inclined to bundle the girl on the bench with criminals and loonies.Here's something for you to do; go to a park, sit on a bench seat, look at people, and remind yourself that each and every person out there is very much like yourself.

Legalizing marijuana (maybe nationwide within the next 20 years if we're lucky?) is a start but it's far from real progress. As long as alcohol and tobacco are legal while other drugs are illegal, the war on drugs is a joke.

167132,1,"Just for context, we know what the consequences of alcohol consumption. So the question is: Why is it on sale on 7-11s then?Legalizing well researched psychedelics like LSD would bring down the consumption of ""spice"", ""bath salts"" and other chemicals that are on sale at corner shops in several countries and whose long term effects have exactly zero studies, much in the same way that legalizing cannabis has decreased consumption of street ""weed"".
"
168433,1,"The question is whether prohibition actually leads to a lower consumption and to what extend it helps organized crime. The experience from the alcohol prohibition in the United States and other similar endeavors makes me think it will do more of the latter than the former.

170519,1,"Close but no cigar.It's a fracking plant, consumed by consenting adults, with no greater negative consequences to society as any other drug. It's so easy to grow and harvest or just buy from others that the law is not doing anything other than making criminals out of people partaking in a relatively harmless activity.I don't think this situation can be considered resolved until it's fully legal, medical or no. But this might be a step in the right direction.I don't smoke pot. But I can still support the rights of others to do so.

171546,0,"thanks for being a better parent than my step-dad. When I got caught (20 years ago) he made ME destroy all my pipes and had me dump my stash, although he made me do it in the grass, so I just went back and pick out the dirt.First of all, don't judge him. I want to say that it is weed and not a big deal, but it can be. It can be both good and bad. The good is, it frees your brain from preconceived notions, it allows you to explore your creativity in ways that you never thought possible. It can help with homework, help with focus, it can help with many different things medically, socially. The bad however, is out there. I have seen people think that the only way they can function is to be high, the only way they can deal with life is to be high. I was one of those for a long time. I would wake up, get high, go to work high, school high, do everything high, and I was unmotivated, because I couldn't grasp the concept that it is ok to not be high.Weed can lead to a unmotivated life, but it can also prove to be a powerful tool in creating your life. I live in Texas and I am not close to the wonders of nature out here. I love this subreddit because I see all sorts of people posting about their smoke spots. So some people are motivated to find a place in nature, to sit and think and explore themselves, and to get a bit of karma in the process.Most of all, you're a great did for taking the time to get to know your son and his world. If you make sure he is on top of his world, i.e. does well in class, is courteous, respectful, responsible and can learn to smoke responsibly, allow him to dabble. Under no circumstance should you treat him like a criminal or a loser, as that is the fastest way of pushing him off a cliff. He is a young man learning to be an adult and how you handle this will be how he handles life.good luck and keep us posted.

I'm sure if they could continue selling pot and remain a viable business they would, I don't think they'll be financially sustainable anymore.

174309,1,"I understand where you're coming from. If it was legalized, I'm sure they would probably need to put laws in place about driving while using it, and age requirements to buy. And yes, marijuana can have an effect on the brain, but the current studies of it do not prove that is a cause of brain damage. There is far more evidence that shows that cigarettes can have damaging effects. Whether marijuana is legal or not, it is still going to be used by many. If anything, it will done more irresponsibly while illegal.

190532,1,"While MJ might have similar respiratory impacts as cigs, it's kind of hard to get through an entire pack in a day like serious cigarette smokers do. One issue of MJ legalization is that it may escape the ""sin"" taxes applied to cigarettes that go towards funding public health care. These tax offsets are important in paying for health care to counter the deleterious effects of intentionally inhaling burning stuff. One issue of this is that it would take full on, grow it in your basement yourself legalization, into an area of authorized producers only who are charged taxes based on their production to fund health care to counter impacts. This is a halfway position that many legalization advocates would not agree to. I might not disagree with the legalization of MJ, but there are certain conditions that I think are important that might be considered unacceptable by counter parties. I'll probably eat a lot of downvotes for this, but I would have a problem with legalizing marijuana in a depressed economy with a high overall, especially high youth unemployment rate. I am concerned that an easy form of pharmaceutical escapism could stymie entrepreneurial spirit, in the face of need, or even work ethic altogether. I had myself fallen into a depression of pot smoking during a period of unemployment and I realize it took a certain kind of disgust with my own behavior to start applying for jobs again. I don't mean to downplay the issues of much larger economic issues playing a significant role, but I do feel that wider spread use of MJ could result in a kind of suppression of the bored and underemployed.

You don't have to be rich.It is pretty stupid to give the cops a reason to pull you over when you have weed in the car. 14 over the limit is kinda asking for it. Especially if you've smoked in the car recently. I fully understand the need to make it Sonic before it closes but there are some risks that just shouldn't be taken.

I had been listening to it for a while along with suburbs and it was clicking yet. I got really high at my in laws and on the way home (my wife was driving, don't drive stoned kids!) I put on Tunnels (track one on Funeral). I had magical moment listening to the most beautiful song intro of all time. That's when I got it.You have to really listen to the songs and figure out what they mean to you. The Suburbs specifically details my childhood and will probably remain my favorite for that reason. Also, the line ""I want a daughter while I'm still young, so I can show her some beauty before the damage is done."" Was integral for me accepting I was going to be a father of a little girl. I had really wanted a boy.So, keep listening. AIT down with the lyrics and some weed and get into the music.I am terrible at music and really don't like much music at all.

I am a former member of the US Coast Guard, which also falls under the larger umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security.Every year, COUNTLESS BILLIONS (aka I don't know how much exactly, but its a lot) are spent on the much larger government branch; ""The Department of Defense"". Just about all of this goes towards ""DEFENDING"" the US in *OTHER* countries. Much more high-end machinery is used in this process, and we only ever seem to maintain an offense or kill lots of people on their home turf. Kind of a weird way to defend something right? I've always thought so at least.The DHS on the other hand, is the branch that under no other circumstances other than Congressional approval for dire need during a time of 'war' - will/should always be on US soil or US territorial waters, protecting the country, its infrastructure - and most importantly its citizens - against any form of threat. Sometimes the threat is not a threat at all, like people transporting weed, or people from one of our many surrounding shitty 3rd world countries trying to make it to our land for a better life. Before you ask, YES - I am a white, American-borne male who served in a military service designed to keep people from immigrating to our country illegally - AND I DON'T AGREE WITH IT! What a juicy contradiction!However, not that we've had to worry about it since 9/11 - our job is also *technically* to be a fully armed militarized deterrent from other countries plowing into our dirt and trying to destroy us. I know it sounds funny, because we've never had to since Pearl Harbor, and that we were not able to stop 9/11 from happening - but we also like to think that the reason these events are so rare is because people really don't want to mess with us.Armored tank jeeps, or whatever those things are called (I really don't know), lots of bullets, and boats patrolling our coast lines every day - is just one way that we make sure the only people destroying our country is ourselves.You can completely look at these Jeepurnauts and say ""this is excessive spending that has no functional use"" - that is totally how it should appear in an ideal situation. HELL - if war ever actually broke out in the country (I'm looking at you Florida), these things might ultimately not do a whole lot of good for us - possibly. But until that time comes to pass, we can justify their existence simply by saying ""well we haven't had any terrorists driving 50 ton semi's into capital buildings so something must be working properly.""If you have any other questions on this subject or how I think/feel about it, let me know!Otherwise, continue having a great day :D!

It's just the sanity and progressive outlook I was attracted to.Any place where alcohol and tobacco are welcome but possessing marijuana is a crime is more than a little messed up.

207513,1,"In real life most of us who dont have fathers that are lawyers DO NOT get off on charges like that. It comes down to their word agianst yours and you lose with a public defender. Also, you didn't mention the weed thing. All they gotta do is make something like that up, and they are in. ""I saw him hiding something in his glove box as I pulled him over, he was very nervous so I searched the vehicle and found heroin in the glove box""These reports are written after the fact. The tapes recording the stop in the cruiser are almost never turned in, they just say they aren't recording. MANY people have been arrested for recording the police because of certain states wire tap laws. Yes if all of our father's were lawyers we might get out of things like that, but it isn't the case. I tried to get a gun case thrown out on an illegal search and seizure, and it went like this. COP""The suspect gave me consent to search his vehicle""MY SHIT LAWYER ""My client says he did not (I didnt) why would he do that if he had a loaded handgun in the car?""COP ""Maybe he thought I wouldn't find it, it was hidden well under the seat (No it wasnt)Judge, ""This officer has proven to be an upstanding and reliable man in the eyes of this court, I have no reason not to believe him.Hearing over. I even had a witness. Someone in the car with me that said I never consented. Would it have been different had I a decent lawyer? Yes I bet it would have.

209022,1,"I grew up in a conservative household and life my life by conservative principles. That being said, I have a hard time really knowing what I believe myself. I find it hard to want to legislate certain things because in reality, they don't affect me personally. (My lifestyle won't change because things like pot are legalized) Yeah, it could potentially create problems with some societal decline, but at the same time, I feel like people need to learn from their mistakes once in a while. I wouldn't vote in favor of things that I am morally opposed to, but I might just abstain all together. Does that make me a cop out liberal?

212194,1,"Could you do a skit where two astronauts, after receiving money from pot now being legalized, actually have a budget to perform the first ""blunt walk"". Where a little space shuttle floats independently through space encasing a single blunt.Performed with the 2001 space odesy music.I imagine the blunt space ship to have a little fan to keep the blunt lit with its own jets for mobility. Kinda half bubble half apple mouse. Lil american flag on the side.Houston we have lift off!Super intense stress. Everyone on earth looks. ( people cling to the TV, mission control high-fiving, and the president cheering as well. Post blunt walk )Political premise with comedy intertwined.You guys are my heroes BTW.
