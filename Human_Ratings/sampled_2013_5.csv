2863,1,"Because for every well run pot shop there are 2 that appear to be nothing more than storefronts for shady dealers selling to any and everyone, and people including myself don't want that in the neighborhoods they live in. I fully support legalization, but the quasi-legal status and lack of regulation of dispensaries in L.A. has hurt the legalization movement here. The city council's vote to ban them is a result of tons of pressure from all over, but some of the most vocal opponents are neighborhood councils.I think when this passed, people thought dispensaries would look like some kind of high end boutique shop like somethings out of Weeds. Instead we got dealers opening up shop and behaving like dealers. It is unfortunate.

7731,1,"What is your opinion on the legalization of marijuana?
"
11235,1,"No. They're not in jail because the current stance of the law is that marijuana is bad. They're in jail because they broke the law. The fact that the law has since changed is irrelevant.
"
12182,1,"Unfortunately, the odds are against it. And even more upsetting is the fact that they upheld the illegality of *medical* marijuana as recently as 2005. But we're nearly 8 years on from there and we've seen some considerable changes since. I suppose we'll find out soon, fingers crossed.

18532,1,"Well they are in prison. So unless they are the victim of an unjust law, like a weed conviction, then they are likely there for violence or a large theft. The answer to your question is it applies to everyone who would victimize a fellow human and then get hand flappy excited over their diet fetishes. Now go find something else to get self-righteously butt-hurt over.

24296,1,"I have been on one of these ""booze cruises"" from Stockholm out to a Finnish island and back, in 2007. It started well, at 5pm with a bottle of vodka and some red bulls. Then, however, it was 6am the next morning and I was stuck in, what I thought was a lift with no recollection of how I got there. The last thing I remember is having my third vodka with my Chinese cabin mate, Lui, who I'd met at the backpackers a few days prior. Naturally, I start freaking out, thinking I'm stuck in a service lift somewhere on a massive ship, in a foreign country ( I'm a 22yr old south African kid at this stage), with no wallet, passport, shoes or belt and a split lip with a blood stained shirt. A panicked confusion has already set in. No one hears me screaming. The lift doesn't have the usual 'give' when I'm jumping up and down and the door won't budge. Plus, there are no goddam buttons in this service lift! I'm terrified, thinking we have docked and I'm going to be stuck here for days before the ship sets off again and I might be found. Who the hell punched me!? After going completely berserk for a couple hours trying to attract attention to my situation, I eventually pass out from sheer exhaustion and confusion. I then wake to find myself in another service lift, a different one. This time with three other very hungover looking fellas, looking equally exhausted. After finding out that I was the idiot next door screaming about being stuck in a lift for the past two hours, they kindly inform me that in fact I'm in a holding cell onboard and to just chill out. I settle down. After an hour or two more and the coming and goings of fellow detainees, I'm am taken out of the cell and given all my belongings back and asked to sign the release paper. I do so, all the while asking, angrily, ""which one of you bastards punched me!?"". The very tolerant security personnel tell me that they found me passed out, already bleeding, in someone else's cabin. When security came to wake and remove me I began to swing wildly and blindly in all directions, so they decided to put me into a cell on my own. I return to my cabin, knock on the door as I can't find my key-card, and learn from Lui that his camera and watch have been stolen. He then tells me that we went into the corridor to take a photo or two, when three or four middle eastern looking chaps came up and invited us to go drink in their cabin before we all went up to the clubs onboard. Lui says they pushed him out of the cabin as soon as we all entered. This is all news to me. Though as he tells me the story I begin to have flashbacks of scenes that match. I remember being in a cabin surrounded by strangers and arguing. Lui says their cabin was on our level and ended in the number 62, at a dead end somewhere. FUCK THAT! These guys are still onboard. I go off on a mission, determined to find the bastards that punched me and robbed my friend. After about an hour of walking around I spot, on our level, 3 middle eastern looking chaps walking down the corridor. One turns around and see's me, turns and chats to his friends who then turn to look. They stop for a second and look at me and then begin to walk on. Thats them! I catch up and call for them. They stop and turn around smiling and laughing saying, ""hey man, how are you, how was the rest of your night?"". ""So you guys met me last night huh, which one of you fucking scumbags punched me, which one of you assholes was it!?"". They say something to eachother and all begin walking away. I stay back as they go. They walk around, continuously looking back to see if I'm following them. I figured that Lui's camera and watch must be in their room. They turn left and I see them disappear around a corner, only to come back across a few seconds later. They think they've lost me. I follow their route only to find a dead end with a cabin numbered 3462. Got em, the fuckers. I then go back to my friends at security, explain to them what happened to me and they agree to follow me to their cabin. After the two security chaps force their way into their cabin, one comes out and tells me that they can't find the watch or the camera but that they've ""got them on something else"". I assume its the drug they must have slipped me or some pot or something. I have no idea. That's the last I hear of or see the security and the middle eastern chaps. We return to Stockholm, I say cheers to Lui, and carry on cruising south. That was one of weirdest, most confusing nights/experiences of my life.TL:DR Got drunk, drugged and robbed onboard one of these cruises, found the culprits and then carried on traveling.
"
24960,1,"I get what you're saying but you could have written it much better. The way in which you argue the point along with the grammar mistakes make it a C at best.For example, with legalization and your alcohol prohibition analogy, you could substitute cannabis with cocaine, which was also pretty widespread in the US before prohibition, and used Portugal's lax drug laws as an example for why cocaine is ethical.In all honesty, you should have argued a much more universal and believable argument: Drugs, or what one does to himself, cannot be deemed ethical or unethical, moral or immoral, unless it is an action he or she does not have control over because of physical dependence or psychological disorder, as in the cases or suicide because of clinical depression, or malnutrition from bulimia. In these cases, it is still impossible to definitely say whether or not the actions of the self-victim are ethical or not. The only judge of ethics one could make is one of those in the self-victim's life that chose to help or hinder the victim's ailment.As for marijuana, your case could be much simpler: ""The effects of a drug, whether it be caffeine, nicotine, ethanol, or THC via cannabis, have no relation to ethics. There are good people who are alcoholics, or smoke cigarettes, or drink coffee every day, or who even do all three-- in the same way there are good people who smoke cannabis or otherwise imbibe THC. However, the opposite can also be said; some drunks are violent, some smokers morally crooked, and some coffee drinkers lawyers and bankers. Truly, there do exist ethically bad people who smoke marijuana; but it is not the marijuana that makes them ethically bad, it is only the actions they take that directly effect others and the world around them.""In the end though I would admit that what I did was unethical simply on the basis that I was breaking a contract I agreed to with the school, as well as breaking state law. Not very many laws reflect upright ethics or morals and I would make that case; but avoidably breaking the law is and will always be seen as immoral from the authority's position. And let's be honest; you could have been a lot more careful.
"
25581,1,"No, I know it's not high. But as far as government authoritarianism I would consider myself VERY against, yet the default for people on the left seems to be well into the negatives while I score above 0. All it would take was my being moderately against legalization of marijuana and I'd probably get a fascist result.
"
25916,1,"I'm just going to say it fuck why me, Russia then with the most landmass owned by any country we could the use the native Russians we could build a unstoppable psychopath war machine to take over the world. Then we could focus on the important things like growing marijuana making harmful drugs illegal and making humans immune to the effects of those drugs them pool all our collective resources in to interstellar travel and colonise other planets. Then if one of the countrys we took over wanted we could give the a whole planet and marrone them like in Johnny Dep I pirates of the carrabien.
"
30656,1,"Alright, heres the deal, A 64, allowed for recreational use of marijuana, however, the details of the law have yet to be written and rec sales of marijuana wont start until 2014. There are several ""clubs"" you can join where you only have to be 21 or older and can smoke ""donated"" bud from dispensaries or other ents who bring their own to share. These events are pretty underground now, but wait a year and i believe anyone will be able to visit colorado and buy state legal bud.
"
31227,1,"As someone who's had a serious weed charge... much more serious than this, though I would ever kill myself or any such thing- suddenly getting into major legal trouble can *majorly* fuck with your head. I thought I knew how much it fucked with you before it happened to me, but it was worse, and I live in a relatively progressive (U.S.) state. I can only imagine Oklahoma or something, where you're looking at 10-20 years or who knows what for weed. Enough arresting people for non-violent drug offenses. End this shit.
"
34431,1,"That's a good find. The funny thing about that is the extreme over-generalization of the Tea Party. Sure, the Tea Party movement has been taken over somewhat by the people who cling to their guns and bibles, but it's core principles remain the same. Small govt. is an idea held by Republicans and Libertarians alike and probably a lot of Democrats. However, It reminds me of the video that was going around recently of Ann Coulter saying that we buddy up to Democrats because of pot legalization. She absolutely hates this, not because of the pot thing, but because she hates Democrats. The very thought of a admitting that the team she hates is right about something is too much to bare, so she deflects. Deflects the only way someone like her can. The thing I've realized since becoming a Libertarian is that people that have a team hate those that sit on a fence. And here I am, looking at both sides, seeing great ideas on both sides, and see complete shit ideas on both sides, and not wanting to be on either. I think that this will be the trend for the foreseeable future though. I remember Penn Jillette saying once that the best way he describes Libertarianism is to ""take a sharp right on money and a sharp left on sex and it's straight ahead"". But I think most people just wanna keep turning their wheel left only or right only, and it becomes a NASCAR race.
"
34448,1,"If marijuana is properly legalized, then it becomes just another commodity. If the major suppliers stick a massive mark-up on it, then that provides a huge monetary incentive to growers willing to sell for a slightly lower price -- which in turn incentivizes their competitors to sell for slightly less than that, and so on, until we arrive at a reasonable approximation of the true market price. At no point in this process is altruism necessary. I'm more worried about excessive government taxation and overregulation.
"
36657,1,"you can use mine if you dont want to type your own. Sir/Mam I have heard our state senate introduced a bill to allow and regulate marijuana for medicinal purposes. I would like to take a moment to voice my support of this senate bill, and urge you to vote in support of this bill as well. While some opponents believe marijuana to be a dangerous narcotic, there are many studies which refute these claims. The only thing strict marijuana regulation does to our state is makes criminals out of otherwise law abiding individuals. Denying seriously ill patients the right to medical marijuana will prolong the suffering of a person who otherwise may be able to regain control of his or her life. I am not a user of marijuana, nor am I terminally ill, so while this bill will not impact my life, it may help someone else's and that is why I took the time to email you today. Thank you for reading my message, and I hope to see your support of SB 1250.

58630,1,"""Hey dumbass"" Really? Fuck you bro. Dont be a dick for no reason. You do realize when this happened weed was still illegal in Colorado and not everyone supports or accepts its use. There was a child present and the delivery guy had no idea what kind of usage was going on. For all he knew the dude was illegally distributing 20 lbs+ out of his house with children present (which is child endangerment) Chill the fuck out. Obviously a company will support an employee who is reporting suspected illegal activity. Would you feel the same way on the subject if it was meth the driver smelled and reported? Just because you and I smoke weed and a lot of others do, doesnt take away from the fact it is a schedule I substance. So if anything, the driver who called was doing the community a favor by trying to make sure that everything going on within the household was legal.Obviously I wouldnt have done this, nor do I support his decision, but you have to look at the big picture and the situation
"
64612,1,"You need to educate yourself. You can't say ""well I wouldn't normally look for weed at a park"". The issue isn't where you obtained the weed but the fact that you are in possession of it. Learn the laws, don't get arrested. Educate yourself on how it is, not how you think it should be.
"
64657,1,"While I share your sentiment for the small grower, true legalization will open the market for mega grows. Regretfully for some,protecting our rights > protecting their stake in the market.

71689,1,"We have put too much money into the hands of police and bureaucrats through asset forfeiture laws for drug crimes and ticketing through speeding. This has taken incentive away from the police to actually do what they are sworn to do 'protect and serve'. The problem goes from the very top to the bottom. You can't drive 15 miles over the limit in ohio without getting a speeding ticket, or grow 5 pot plants in your backyard without the police using a helicopter to raid you, but you can keep 3 women captive for ten years and they won't bat an eye.

I even like discussing the legality and morality of the laws. But, my favorite part is the community, tokers, growers, blowers and everybody else associated with this plant that is illegal for no logical reason. I have met some very interesting people just because of this one plant. To some it may just be a drug, but to me its my passion, my hobby and my drug of choice.

If they find THC in your blood or weed on you, there is a possibility you'd stay in jail longer than a person having crack or heroine.Basically, after E-Sens got convicted and sent to jail after a public apology, his career was realistically over. Most celebrities who get in huge scandles lose their entire career because the Korean media, public, and government are so controlling of what is shown on TV and on the internet.But this feature is just basically him rapping about how he's sorry and how he should've been a role model to his listeners, etc. Shit's pretty deep, esp with the progression of the strings and soft pianos in the beat into some nice shit that Primary managed to flip half way through the song in terms of the beat.[T'oor Tae Hip Hop Giseu T'oh - Verbal Jint (Sirene Remix)](http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Siren+Remix/2UT0qd?src=5)Verbal Jint is pretty damn underrated.

The supreme court also ruled that corporations are people and that medical cannabis falls under the interstate commerce clause. The SCOTUS is an activist court and they have gone full retard.My point is regarding the poll tax issue. If a person is required to spend money before they can vote, it's a poll tax. Pretty simple really. You can gobbledygook it to death, but at its core it's a very simple argument, and once again, the SCOTUS is absolutely wrong.

100886,1,"I'd say social issues in general are a distraction. By this I mean things like gay rights, gun control, legalization of weed etc. They're super important problems don't get me wrong. The problem might even be that they're TOO important. They make it impossible to see any of the more boring yet still stupidly important things that go on. For example, last week with the DOMA act being shot down. The court also shot down part of the voting rights act. Which will probably lead to thousands of people being not able to vote in the future. Additionally when the court struck down prop-8, thus allowing gay marriage in California, it was widely celebrated, as it should be. But the court did this ""on standing"" meaning the case never should have been allowed to come before them. This means that the court said a group of citizens are not allowed to bring cases before certain courts, it has to be done by a Governor or someone in power. So while we're all celebrating gay rights, we have actually lost a lot too.Also these topics are so important to people all a candidate has to do is say ""I'm pro-choice"" or ""I'm pro gun"" and they instantly get almost everyone's vote. The rest of their agenda, or stances on topics becomes unimportant. The government is free to run wild and do whatever shady stuff they want, so long as they keep saying they're for whatever social issue will get them the most votes.Now I'm not saying people should ignore social issues or anything like that. I don't know what the solution to this would be, but I'm sure it won't happen overnight.

101168,1,"Legalize marijuana, maybe a few other less dangerous drugs. Decriminalize the rest, but make smuggling narcotics into the country punishable by death.All convicts on death row get a new trial. If there is clear and incontrovertible evidence they did it, or they admit to it, any serial killers or rapists are executed immediately. Other crimes (like singular murderers that end up on the row due to the nature of the killing) are reviewed. Any with any reasonable chance at redemption are given long sentences with a chance for parole if they prove themselves; those irredeemable are executed immediately.Review the general prison population. Lesser drug crimes and the like are all released provided they haven't gotten worse in prison. The rest are all put on a track to getting their shit straight. As soon as they show reasonable willingness to be a part of a productive society, they're released.The heads of banks, etc that cause our economy to be fucked up...dropped to no more than 100k a year salary, the rest of their employees earning over that scaled down accordingly. However they will be reviewed mercilessly. Any found scamming the general public well be arrested. The smaller fish get jail time and most of their assets seized; the really big ones (like the enron guys) are executed if convicted and their assets seized. Proceeds go towards the homeless and others in need.Minimum wage increased substantially. Taxes will increase as well, but on a scale; lower incomes will see little to no change, but the rich may pay double what they have been.Abortion is legal, but discouraged unless it's a medical/criminal necessity. Birth control is taught in public schools mandatory and encouraged in private schools. Economic and ethics classes as early as middle school. Teach the kids to be responsible, not know how to pass a test. Logic classes at least as early as high school.Instead wages for the military...enlisted personnel only. Major inquires into military spending, esp the tons going to private contractors such as Lockheed. Congress can stay and skill handles most of the law. But no more filibusters. No more wasting time. Also one bill: one item. No more pork. Pull any of that bullshit and you are banned from public office for life and most of your assets seized.Open immigration for anyone that wants to come to America. But they must pay taxes, must find a job, must be productive to society or be deported after two years.Tort reform. Nuff said.Welfare reform. Anyone found to be abusing the system loses any rights to assistance permanently, as well as jail time. Increased funds to those that need. Focus on getting people on their feet and offs the system asap.I have a few other ideas...not really important. I'd be assassinated in a week.

One of the convenient things about shrooms is that they are impossible to get addicted to. Your body develops a virtually instant tolerance to them, and you have to wait at least a week before you can trip again. Some say a few days...but I call bullshit...you end up having to take a much higher dose, which is a waste, IMO.

109557,1,"Zimmerman is obviously an asshole, and obviously a teenager is dead because of him, but it isn't his fault or Martin's fault that the laws in Florida, or in a larger sense the laws of the United States allowed for something like this to happen. It isn't the jury's fault either and it most certainly isn't the fault of whites and blacks everywhere. I don't know if it was ""racism's"" fault, or if such a thing is even possible... Racism has certainly been the fault of many murders, but here... even if Zimmerman was a racist, or was racially profiling Trayvon... it just doesn't seem genuine. If he was some Filipino kid, or some kid from El Salvador, or Nicaragua and everything else was equal? I think Zimmerman still fires his weapon.As far as I see it... the only relevant thing race has to do here is whether the shoes were on the other foot would the nation & outcome have been the same: If Zimmerman was black, and Martin was white. Would marijuana be bad? Would he be charged with murder, with the option for manslaughter on the table, or would it be a hate crime? Zimmerman's life is obviously ruined either way, and Martin's life is over, but the facts in this case didn't support a conviction. If Zimmerman was black would they have?TL; DR - The worst thing I think is that despite the fact ""race"" is again in the media (which elevates it in the national consciousness and keeps it a fresh part of the national conversation, which is healthy) no one in the media, or even really in the black (or white) community seems to be highlighting the relevant racial issues at play: That America's gun laws disproportionately impact black communities, and that if Zimmerman was black he'd likely have been guilty... even though he was obviously innocent.

The even more convincing argument is that making abortion illegal will not stop women from getting abortions, it will merely create another dangerous black market like marijuana market (which we can expect to become less violent, more safe, more productive, and cheaper thanks to the allowance of free interactions between people. If we legitimately could stop abortions from happening, it would be a different debate I would be more sympathetic toward your side of things, since I would think a woman immoral for terminating a baby in the third trimester and would strongly encourage her not to do so...still I would not force her nor use governmental power (aka have others force her for me)

If they were failing to adhere to those guidelines AMD breaking the state's laws, they can and will be at risk of criminal punishment. And in cases such as this, it's the DEA's jurisdiction. This might not have been the Fed ignoring the state's wishes; it may have been then having to do their job because these dispensaries were breaking state laws.

118345,1,"Obviously a throw away account. BUT STORY TIME! :DOh, I remember my first 10. It was with my best friend, we had been best friends back then for about 5 years, and we had been smoking for 2 of them. Any who, I had this badass whale pipe, that held 1.7 g, and I was so eager to try it out, I used all $65.00 from my Birthday for some 8 g's of blue berry kush. Hit up my best friend, told him to sneak out, and meet up at the park, as usual.I pull out my piece, and was so proud of it, it just gave me the giggles. Then, out came that super sticky Kush. That night was the night that I learned, that was the best $65.00 I would ever spend. After we packed our bowl, we went under the awning, sat down at the tables, and started toking. That first rip, was enough to put me up to a 2 or 3. The way the bowl was made, it just held to cherry, and you could just rip on the bowl as soon as you got it back. After the second bowl, I was at about an 8, and thought for sure I was peaking. It felt like each hit wasn't making me any higher, only extending the length of my peak. After we were both geeking hard as fuck, we decided to take a break for a few minutes. He is probably at a solid 8, or 8.5, and so am I. After what felt like 10 minutes of laughing at nothing, we decided to start back up. Fast forward 10 minutes, and the bowl is almost empty, and bam it hits me. Like a ton of bricks. I'm high as fuck, I thought. I then felt the bench I was sitting on turn sideways, like I was going to slide off. I thought to myself that I was going to slide off, but then I realized, I'm high as fuck right now, so I stood up. That was the weirdest feeling in the world. It was like I was moving faster than my brain could process the world. I quickly sat back down.After sitting there for about 15 or so minutes (about an hour in ""I'm high as fuck"" time) thinking about just how I feel, and life in general, I thought about what I had eaten, and drank that day... Which gave me the munchies almost immediately. I tell my friend that I'm hungry as fuck, and he immediately said he was too. So, I asked him if we could make it to McDonalds, or Taco Bell… I don't even remember thinking about cops patrolling or anything, all I thought about was some delicious hot French fries, and 4 mcdoubles. Where we were, it was like 2 miles walk to get to either one of those places. We started walking, ended up tripping out over a car that passed us, thinking it was a cop, and that the cop was going to turn around and arrest us, we hit the neighborhood streets, and yards, walking oh so carefully at a (10). About an hour of that bullshit walking, we made it. I remember thinking, holy shit, we have made it!!, thinking back, I really don't know why or how we made that trek at a (10). What I had forgotten, was that everyone else wasn't high as fuck, or as happy as I was. So, when I went inside McDonalds, and ordered FIVE mcdoubles, a large fry, and a large drink, my best friend got a HUGE kick out of this, and we both started geeking, until we were both in tears.We finally stopped laughing, and he ordered a large Big Mac meal, and the girl placing our order was cool as fuck. She knew EXACTLY what was up. She was the only reason why we didn't get in trouble that night.We sat down, and after about 2 minutes of waiting, she actually brang us our food. Me and my friend began laughing at how much food we just ordered, and started eating. After eating all but one of my mcdoubles, I was done. He was done and we were ready to head back. We threw our trash away, and the girl behind the counter called out, ""Hey wait!"" We thought we were busted, but this girl was carrying a Big Mac. she just hands it to my friend, and says, ""You guys can split it when you get the munchies again."" Laughs and walks away. We left feeling good as fuck. We managed to walk back normally with no cars or anything, still on a 9.5 or 10, but a solid 9 for sure. I realized I still had more weed. I said to him, ""wake and bake tomorrow, so get up."" And he started laughing again. We messed around on my phone a bit playing a game, geeking, just overall having a grand time, then we said our goodbyes, and headed for home. I was so relieved that my bed was warm, and everything was as it should be. Feel asleep after putting on Kid Cudi's Man On the Moon II. Forgetting what I had in my pockets, 2.5 g's of smelly weed, a mcdouble, and a pipe.Woke up before my parents, sprayed air freshener in my room, and ate my mcdouble. Called my friend to tell him I'm coming over, then woke my mom up, told my mom that I was going over to my friends house, went over to his house and fell asleep. The best night of my life, to this day. Hands down. My best friend and I have not been closer ever before. I could room with this guy for ever and be completely fine with it. My parents and his parents didn't say a word about anything, and to this day, I really think we got away with that 10. This was when I was 16, if you're wondering.

In Colorado at least officers on duty are wearing a vest over a shirt under a uniform, on a sunny day that's sweltering, so they're going to find any excuse to stay in someplace with shade and AC, they're also probably messing around on their computer, running plates, checking out what other officers are doing and staying in touch. As a third part they can feel as distanced from the community as the community does from them. Say an officer does decide, ""Hey fuckit, I'm gonna go talk to people and see what they think."" They're likely(sometimes) to get the blank stare of ""ohgod what did I do, does he know about the pot, does he know about the parking ticket?"" The person probably mutters something and goes about his day.

But you don't believe that all drug use should be punished. only certain drugs and not others. Now you seem to be saying they should be regulated, but should we still punish their use?If an adult wants to get high and he understands the consequences, I don't think (s)he should be punished for that. Be it alcohol, caffeine, Xanex, or marijuana. It's not my business what other consenting adults do if it doesn't affect me personally.My only point in bringing up alcohol prohibition was to illustrate that prohibition of any drug *doesn't work*.

Now there is evidence to the contrary we get told people are hiding behind the medical benefits.Maybe that's how the reactionary media handles it, but I'm not representative of that.> What you are calling 'Weed Culture' is how weed is represented in media you have personally seen, it isn't representative. They aren't elected spokesmen.I don't listen to rap or watch TV. The only content I see that has stoner stereotypes is comedy shows like Futurama, South Park, etc., which I buy the box sets of rather than watch live. None of them promote the ""sup bro 420 go get high or ur a feggit"" attitude - they show the stereotypical chilled / laughing / hungry stoner. The reality I see is from stoners I know who act the way I described. Not all of them are like that, but they're a majority. It seems to be that weed becomes part of their identity, rather than a vice. That's an abusive relationship, which just goes to show that a large number of people can't be responsible. Maybe that attitude would go away with legality, because it's not seen as ""cool"" any more, but I'm not convinced.> You will see the worst of it because rapper is one of the few jobs you won't get fired for smoking on weekends. You can't expect interviews on the news with white collar professionals who smoke when it is still illegal.Er... no? Many jobs, especially with small companies, treat weed use outside of work hours as acceptable. This might be a minority, and geographically dependent, but it's not been socially taboo in englightened circles for a long time.> What you see are the people who don't fear punishment, not the average user.Not following the logic there.

If you think only voting for a candidate that can win is the only way to vote, then you are saying that you're banking on the odds that you'll be that vote. That will never happen.If instead you view your vote as a vote for your voice, then we're talking. You see, politicians want to win. That's really all they care about. And to try to win they try to look at what issues people are voting for. When they lose, or saw someone else lose, they will look at the issues they won with, the issues they lost with, and the issues that people voted third party on.Those are some key issues right there. Usually the issues that differentiate candidate Red from candidate Blue are pretty set in stone, but there are tertiary issues in the third party candidates that they will look to. Maybe both parties are ignoring marijuana, but party C is for legalization. Maybe both parties are turn offs to the local immigrant population, but party C is drawing their attention.Voting for someone that you *agree* with, is the only way to get your vote to count.

Most of the people I know that get in their car through their in-house garage, drive to work, park in underground, take the elevator to their office, eat lunch in the cafeteria, drive back home to the same garage and watch TV all night want a cyclist licensing system to be structured like a sin tax. They have such a low opinion of cyclists that they want to legally classify it on the same level of drinking alcohol or recreational marijuana use.

This is seriously glorifying weed.Sure, meth/cocaine/heroin/most drugs really are more dangerous than weed, but weed hasn't exactly done people only good either.

I don't get the whole ""everything but psychedelics are dangerous and should be kept illegal"" thing a lot of people have going here.In my opinion, all drugs should be legalized, they should be regulated, some more strictly than others, and people should be informed of effects.

155924,1,"In MA the smell of weed does not allow a officer to search a person, car or home. If officers ask to enter your property and you say no, they have no legal means to enter unless they get a warrant. And in MA they can't get one because they smell weed!Edit: More MA stuffMA MMJ Recommendations:With a ""medical recommendation letter"" from a doctor (we don't have licenses yet) I can buy weed from dispensaries / grow my own. Since Ma doesn't have any dispensaries yet, registered ""Caretakers"" (legal dealers) are allowed to grow and sell weed to limited amounts of patients. My caretaker like most has been growing and selling for a while... Now it's just legal for her to do it! As a (MMJ recommendation holder) I can have up to 10oz of harvested bud in my place of loving at any 1 time. I can also grow my own plants (I micro grow) until MA finishes constructing the laws around MMJ and then I will have 1 year after that time to continue growing my own plants. After that year I can apply for ""hardship"" which means I can't drive to a dispensary or a ""caretaker"" (ie licensed grower)... Then I can keep growing my own stuff. I won't be to get a hardship license, but I'm still going to apply for one (might slip through the cracks)... I just like growing little unique strains! Micro Jack Grow: http://i.imgur.com/JQv5N5p.jpgSo what happens of you don't have a recommendation or are caught smoking in public in MA? Well if you have &lt; 1 oz on you then you'll love this next part! Between now and when the laws are finalized, anyone in MA that gets a ticket for smoking ~$100, does not have to show ID to the officer even of they ask for it. That means you can tell them any name you want! Also, and more importantly....even of you tell them your actual name.. There's no place to send the ticket with payment. No system has been established yet like they have for parking tickets etc. So you can't even pay the fine of you want to! Once the laws are finalized I and everyone else with a recommendation will submit them for ""review"" and they will convert that into a license, much like CA. Until then.. It's somewhat of a free for all, but use your best judgment and don't bring attention to yourself type situation. TL;DR: -- Smell alone does not warrant a search in MA - We don't have licenses yet, people with recommendations can possess up to 10oz in their home at any 1 time. And grow their own plants. - Caretakers are more or less legal growers since we don't yet have dispensaries- If you do get a ticket for smoking / having less then 1 oz on you there's no place to send the $$ ...

That applies to all the individuals involved here, whether corporate executives or politicians or union leaders or lobbyists.But since all of these individuals are acting within a *system* that results in undesirable social outcomes, I am more inclined to blame the system than any of the individual people involved. Since systems are comprised of interdependent parts, it is sometimes difficult to make a clear attribution of causation to just one of those parts - just as it can be difficult to answer the question, ""which part of a car's engine makes the car go?"" Well, you need a lot of parts working together to have a functioning engine.Having said this, some parts of a system nevertheless tend to be more vulnerable to change than others. We call these ""high leverage"" points, where small changes of conditions can lead to very large changes in outcomes.In the case of the prison industrial complex and its relationship with politics, I would argue that the points of highest leverage are drug policy: simply legalizing marijuana would likely result in radical transformation, and legalizing *all* drugs following the alcohol model would certainly do so. A few strokes of the pen could upend the entire system. By contrast, removing dozens or even hundreds of corrupt CEOs, judges, politicians, and police officers from the system will make little difference, as new people will quickly step into their empty shoes.So rather than blame individuals and target our efforts (and anger) toward them, I think it is more prudent to focus on changing drug policy. The good news is that we can get this done - all we need to do is vote!

Being tired, overly emotional, light headed from smoking cigarettes, prescription medication, being distracted by passengers, being distracted from advertising.If people can smoke pot and do extreme sports that put their life on the line at the same time i don't see why MJ should be treated any differently than the other above reasons that I've mentioned. Besides the fact that it's illegal to begin with.

189913,1,"The thing is with boycotts is, if you think they a company will just dissolve because people boycotted it, you're wrong. It's only a very rare occurrence that companies do pack up shop, or go under. However, a lot of times that boycotts are successful, the company suffers enough, or enough bad publicity was gathered, that they stop their bad practices.But, no matter if a boycott fails, you are not forced to do business with the company, and can sustain your own moral/ethical boycott and use another competing company, or do no business with anyone in that industry.Personally, I don't like ACA because it forces people to purchase something from an industry that I completely loathe, under penalty of law. But, at least there are choices people can make in regards to who they do business with. Under a single payer plan, I am forced to only do business with one entity, the government, which I loathe more than insurance companies. And, when the government is in the sole business of something, they will enforce you to do business with them with a threat of jail, at the end of a gun.The US Government is especially inefficient at providing services. Just look at medicare. The next time you go into your Dr's office, you'll probably see a sticker that says they don't accept it. I guarantee that if single payer became an actual law, [you'll see a lot more of this.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/your-money/dealing-with-doctors-who-accept-only-cash.html) Unless the government decides to force Dr's to not practice, or accept their insurance, which will happen to enforce their monopoly.So you ask what can we do about healthcare? Well, we can start providing incentives for healthcare companies to stop doing the practices which lead to the ACA, like lowing their tax costs. We can crack down on frivolous medical malpractice suits that actually get billed to health insurance plans. We can stop being the worlds police, and use that money to subsidize those who can't afford health plans. We can legalize, and tax, marijuana and put that towards healthcare.There are dozens upon dozens of things we can do to alleviate the cost of healthcare and make it affordable for all, without the government stepping in and forcing people to do what it wants, usually because it is a revenue stream into our politicians, and their donors pockets.If it wasn't for government meddling in the first place during WWII and imposing pay restrictions, which lead to companies offering healthcare to lure employees, which lead to the outrageous costs we're seeing today, we wouldn't be having this discussion right now.About the only thing you can trust the government to do, is make your life miserable, and fuck shit up.

190109,1,"I think it makes more sense to legalize it as the harm the drug itself causes does not outweigh the problems caused by it being illegal.That said I don't understand why everyone thinks this is a good thing. We, as a modern society, should be moving away from consuming recreational drugs, not taking more.There needs to be a clear education program included with this legislation highlighting the dangers of smoking. They run the risks of people assuming they condone the activity by legalising it, which really isn't the case at all.You only have to look at the replies to this thread to see how many people seem to assume smoking weed is a perfectly safe activity. It is fairly safe for most people BUT not for everyone.In the perfect world none of us would be smoking it for non medicinal reasons and there would be no tobacco or alcohol either. We should know better.tl:dr Everything should be legal but no one should be having any fun. Clearly I've become a grumpy old man.

190281,1,"> “We have close to a million people who use it on a regular basis. It’s a market of $1.65 billion here in New York City every year, so it makes sense, seeing as so many people are using it on a regular basis, to decriminalize it,” Liu said.This is terrible. There are good arguments for the legalization of marijuana, but this is not one of them. If there were a ton of people lying on their taxes, would it make sense to make that legal too?

Laws on marijuana are changing... so the system is working. I don't see the issue.

191805,1,"The key is to not smoke too much . If your going to get the medicinal benefit, you have to treat it like a medication. if your interested here's my story I get a good Indica strain. I smoke just a bowl in the morning. i try to find the dose so it will help me focus and stay on task through out the day but not fuck me up to the point where i am high (nothing over a [2] ). this alone reduces my frustration with general tasks, I also communicate better because I can have conversations longer than 2 minutes before my mind wonders or explodes with a million things I want to say. the weed also has a calming effect so I am not so snappy at people (that's not an ADHD symptom, sometimes i'm just a grumpy bastard) by taking controlled doses consistently I can still be Me . Just a little less speedy and little less hyper a little less disorganized and a lot more happier person. it's not addictive and for me there are no horrible side effects (less the chance of getting caught and arrested) No other medication ever gave me that. they all had horrible effects. I did not feel like I was myself most day. they messed with my emotions, I would be suicidal. homicidal , and happy in a matter of 10 minutes when I was taking some of them. Others made me feel like a zombie and I couldn't move like I was in slow motion , one of them fucked up my liver and landed me in the hospital (tegratol I think) but not weed. nope. Weed just helps me be me, but better. and the proof is in how other people accept me. before I started smoking around 21 years old I could not hold down a job, everyone around me was overly annoyed at me and some people just didn't like me because I was soo hyper. after weed I am now a Network and Systems administrator for a pretty decent size .com that specializes in Advertising tracking and well respected at my job. I accomplish many tasks and even take the lead on most projects. People in my social life have noticed and all agree I am much better off . I also annoy myself a lot less. .. and the best part. I still smoke sativa recreationaly on a Friday or Saturday night and enjoy it very much . in fact I'm kinda stoned right now , hence the long winded story no body asked me to write.

195141,1,"That's interesting seeing how colorado trumps federal law with legalization of pot. Just because one court says its wrong doesn't mean its right. The court actually combined the 1st and 14 amendment to come up with seperation of church and state. Basically the court just made it up. The founders did not want the federal governmeant to have a state sponsored religion like that england. However the states were left to act on their own accord and could establish there own state religions if they want. Some states like new Hampshire actually put in there state constituions that the governmeant should express religious ideas to the people. For years the left have rewrote history to justify there pointes. The founding of America is the greatest example of it.

195487,1,"No it wasn't. Obama ran on a platform in 2008 that didn't support Cannabis or Gay Marriage. He had to play to the centre to get elected, which is actually very conservative in the puritanical US. And while the progressive forces have turned the political tide enough to let Obama publicly support Gay Marriage, it has taken two states to legalize cannabis in the face of a continuing Federal prohibition in Obama's second term.

"
111547,0,"Well I think the social nature of marijuana is that of inclusiveness and sharing. Which is why when you're smoking with others you always pass the joint, instead of each of you smoking their own joint, which is common with cigarettes. Since most of us have this social mindset, offense can be taken when one is excluded from the activity.
"
112784,0,"Because its untrue. You are apparently using two different standards for impairment. If I take 2 to 4 hits of high grade marijuana. I feel the effects, but I am **not** intoxicated. Same as if I drink one pint of a good stout beer. Again, I feel the subtle effects but am not actually yet intoxicated. Frankly the threshold of impairment possible using marijuana is much lower than that possible using alcohol. Let's say I took four shots of liquor in less than an hour. There is no amount of pot that I could smoke and reach the same physical impairment. Granted, I have also been a frequent pot smoker for 20 years. But as someone with the experience you have, how in the world can you sit there and make the statement that marijuana is more intoxicating? If you are comparing taking an hour to drink a bud light well then be fair and compare it taking an hour to smoke a bowl of low grade schwag. In any case it depends on the person's body chemistry, experience and imo pathology. But in the case of you and I, they are comparable and we would not be intoxicated in either case. I take some offense at this misinformation that you have presented above.
"
123801,0,"(Posted as a reply in the thread, reposting as a comment to share my thoughts):I can't speak for everyone, but for myself, the way the movie portrayed the ""world as it is today"" is why I hated it. The movie treats us like we are stupid and need to be spoon fed simple details. ""These people are poor and dirty and these people are rich and wear polos and talk like robots.""There is no need to force fed us useless crap like that. Case in point: when Jodie Foster walks into the command center, some idiot producer/director thought, ""let's hand her a cup of tea to remind viewers she is rich and powerful."" Your reasoning for why people disliked the movie is ass backwards to me. The rest is preference. The movie was poorly written, but the actors saved what little their was. The action was AWESOME at times, but by far the worst shaky cam movie I've ever scene. Case in point: the airplane scene with the grenade was one of the worst filmed scenes in recent and distant memory. The hand to hand combat was also hit or miss. I'd say about 60% of it was a jumbled mess and the rest was decent enough to see what was going on. I don't like being treated like an idiot while watching a movie. For me, this is an extremely dumb movie with poorly filmed action scenes. It's extremely shallow (Elysium has NO detail in the movie and is only wanted for their Med Bay technology) and there are so many plot devices. So there is a scene where Kruger harasses Matt Damon's ""girlfriend"", which I would even argue the flying droid didn't see him leave the premise, but they could have just inspected nearby houses, but he ends up kidnapping her. Why? He has no real reason to believe she knows who he is or where he is going. And even if she did know him or knew where he was going, there is no reason to kidnap her, because the next scene shows Matt Damon turning himself in. So why is she there? So there can be a scene at the end of him sacrificing himself for her/the world. More shallow bits: what is this stupid government that can be ""rebooted""? You can't just say, ""with this virus/program, we can override the system"". WHAT SYSTEM? How does rebooting the system allow for Jodie to become president? They would simply say, ""Uh, no. There was a malfunction and your presidency is invalid as such."" And even then, why does Jodie want power? It's clearly not a dictatorship society and even if you argue that it is, then why can't the president not have Spider arrested at the end of the movie? There is no real power. It shows a council and they even vote in one scene of the movie with their hand prints as a signature. So Jodie could make herself president just so she could have MORE power over defense systems? No, she would just be voted out. If the president had power, he would have not called a vote to decommission Kruger, he would have just ordered it to be done. The exo suit in itself is pretty silly and shallow. I can't remember a scene where it actually matters, other than to show Matt Damon fighting against a droid and make it so people can't say, ""HEY! A droid would crush a human!"". He never uses the suit (nor is the suit explained at all), to do anything useful. At least Kruger uses the battery power of the suit to produce a force field to block bullets. Then at the end, they both have suits anyways, so may as well be human vs human anyways. The suits are only there to allow fights to elaborate on physics and not have people question it. But even then, they never use these advantages. Matt Damon bends a car door, throws a guy far across a room, Kruger jumps SUPER high, and they fight and kinda of push each other harder than normal. Extremely shallow. The opening scene was horribly cliched. Meets a girl and the child actor says, ""You and me forever, babe. I'll take you to Elysium one day."" Again, this is just a plot device to advance the story later, so the very end can have Matt Damon say, ""I told you I'd take you to Elysium.""So the exo suit is useless. Elysium is useless and only used for Med Bays. Matt Damon getting cancer was a useless plot device just to give him an INSTANT reason to get the suit, rather than have well written scenes of Matt deciding what he wants to do. The writer simply thought, ""If Matt Damon was dying, he would have no reason to say no! And we can film that in ONE scene!"". Shallow, shallow, shallow.I'd also argue that people on Earth seem to be decently tech savy and they could possibly build their own Med Bays, but that is debatable. I would argue, why do they risk going to Elysium, when their only purpose is to break the window with a flower pot (pretty sure they used 2-3 flower pots to break windows in that movie) and then return to Earth? At the end, these ships bring a ton of Med Bays down to Earth. Did they not know these Med Bays were in this hangar? Why did they not try to break into the hangar and steal the ships? Then, I'd argue, if Elysium doesn't want Earth civilians breaking in and using Med Bays, why not just kill them? They obviously don't have a problem with it because the opening scene states that droids killed 13 civilians after they land safely. So the only risk of going to Elysium is being blown up by a missle, but If you make it, you get healed and will be deported back to Earth for free.JUST KILL THEM. And if you say, ""Well, they don't kill on Elysium."" then I go back to my first point where the opening scene shows them kill 46 civilians with missles and another 13 with guns/droids. And EVEN if you say, well that was a mistake, then I'd argue if they don't want to kill them, then just GIVE THEM THE FUCKING MED BAYS IN THE SHIP IN THE HANGAR! That is the ONLY reason they want to come to Elysium. It's not like any of these people thing they will land on Elysium and blend in and become citizens. The movie was extremely fucking shallow. And as shallow as it was, it was constantly shoving the shit down our throats like we are idiots. ""Matt Damon is poor! They are rich! Matt Damon must save the poor people! What a nice guy!""However, the CGI was awesome for about 99.9% of the movie. And some scenes that weren't a shaky cam mess were great. The atmosphere was nice for the poor people, even if spoon fed. But the movie was extremely lazy. /rant

126412,0,"BACKGROUND: I was still in high school and had a class ENG102 where we had serious, formal debates. Around this time we had a debate after we got back from the weekend, and I was chosen as the leader of my team. Being the leader, I have to collect everyone's information and group email/text my peers about strategies and key-points that we could use to win the debate. On my team was probably the most attractive girl in the class(that's not saying much) and of course yours truly has her number.Around 8 months ago, I was invited to my friend's 23 birthday party. At this point in time, I was 17 and a senior in high school. I drive over to the restaurant where he planned a dinner first, just a few people were getting together. I arrive at the establishment and to my left I see a massive, king-like dining table with about 20 people around it. I see my friend Mario, a giant of a man with a beard similar to Hagrid's, kinda hard to miss. I make my way over to the table and manage to snag a chair. For the next 2 hours we eat, we roar with laughter and we relax. The bills are collected and its time to call it a night, all of a sudden Mario wraps his shoulder around me and says ""We're going to Jose's for a party, you down?"" I of course say yes. Fast forward 10 minutes and I've entered this incredible bro house. The first thing you smell in the air is weed and alcohol, a festive location. This was the house of 3 young adults, one of them was a full time pot dealer of course. I sit down at their kitchen table and a kind gentleman hands me 4 beers. Another 6 people accompany me at the table and one of them whips out a fresh deck of cards and says, ""Who's ready to fuck the dealer?""(Fuck the dealer, a drinking game). Fast forward an hour of drunken laughing, rosy cheeks and clever remarks, we're all wasted and know one has a sense of right and wrong, especially me. I find it a fantastic idea to let these sex deprived 23-26 year old drunken dead beats get my phone and text people. They find their way to the most attractive girl in my English class, (I have a smart phone so you can see a picture of the person you're texting) they found their victim. The group of 6 proceeded to text this 18 year old girl ""hey bb, you up?""(it was 3am) ""Your personality is almost as big as your ass"" and other embarrassing things.Next morning, I sober up and read the cringe-fest. Got ready for school and headed for the debate, I was legitimately disappointed in myself. First and second hour passes, now its 3rd hour. I walk into class with my head held high like nothing happened. The seats are divided and everyone is mostly in there seats leaving me the last one to enter class. EVERYONE was staring at me, which led to my realization that this 18 year old girl, is a chatty-cathy, drama spawning whore. The following minutes changed my life, I could've walked over and told her the whole thing wasnt my fault blah blah blah, I sat my ass down, looked right at her and gave her a wink. From that point on, I didn't care, I simply acknowledged it as a funny story to tell and that's that. BUT THATS NOT THE END!A few months later I attend a party at the same house, same people and it happened AGAIN! Still didn't give a fuck. Now I've made sure I can't access my phone in those situations.TL;DR: In high school I went to a party, got drunk and several guys in their mid 20s got my cellphone and texted the most attractive, fresh out of jailbait, gossipy girl in my English class, twice. From which I never confronted her about it.EDIT: written on mobile so excuse all the grammar and structure and I'm quite late to this thread.EDIT: Forgot the TL;DR

128159,0,"I used to know Joe Son. If your not familiar with the name he played Random Task (the guy who throws the shoe) in Austin Powers. He used to buy pot from my roommate and he was honestly the weirdest guy I have ever met. He would start screaming in public for no reason and constantly try to pick fights with people. Sometimes he would comeover to pick up literally with a tshirt wrapped around his waist and nothing else on. He hated when you brought up the fact he was the guy who threw the shoe. One time my friend got so pissed at him that he took off his shoe and threw it at him, it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. I lost track of him around 05, and a couple years later he was arrested for a rape/torture he committed in the early 90's. I knew he was crazy, but did not know he was capable of that. So glad I only knew him for like a year. Here is a link to his wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Son

I donate to planned parenthood all the time because they helped a younger dumbass me prevent getting my gf pregnant. Roads are provably and inarguably for the common good. Whether you use them yourself or not, it doesn't take a trickle-round for you to benefit from their existence. Also, you are forcing me to give you my assets by threat of imprisonment - whether you want me to pay for your healthcare or join your insurance scam, it's all robbery. Maybe it's because you haven't properly seen both sides of the world. I believe in survival of the fittest. If you need tech to survive but are unable to procure that tech, you are weak. What of those like me who strongly oppose doctor visits, who want almost 100% removed from the system. Oh and I don't think people shouldn't go for life-saving surgeries/medicines or anything, it's just people are so quick to use tech instead of healing. I don't know what your condition is - you'll tell me if you want me to know but it's none of my business, but I have weaknesses, myself. I'm unable to eat properly, I can't get myself to gain weight because I'm so...weak in that way. People tell me I should smoke pot for it. That's not growth, that's a crutch. To rely on something else to heal me!?!?! So ya, I don't visit the doctor unless I'm bleeding out of the ears...and I'm gonna see if I can patch myself up myself first because THAT'S personal growth. Now, with how detached I am from this system, how can anyone tell me I still must pay to be a part of it?

156901,0,"My in-laws teapot. Its spout is slanted in a wrong angle, so you can't pour tea without spilling a lot. The spout is also geometrichally challenged so that you have to tilt the pot so much to pour that the lid slides off. The handle is shaped so that while tilting the pot, your hand will slide up and connect with the hot pot so the grip is uncomfortable. They have used that pot every time we've been over for the last decade, and they (and we) complain just as much every time. My husbands uncle have now announced that he has bought a new one, hopefully a better one, for the upcoming birthday in october, so hopefully It'll be better next time.

178559,0,"Look, I will be the first to admit that I have done some stupid shit in my life. I have lacked the best judgement in a lot of decisions I made, particularly when under the chemical influence of other bad decisions. This is part of the reason I have never run for public office. Not only do I know that I do not always have the best judgement, I know how my past lapses will appear to a public when they find out about them after voting me into office.All that being said, I can forgive a lot in my elected officials. Bill Clinton smoked some weed in college. A lot of people have, maybe not the best idea, but hell, it's not that uncommon. G. W. Bush had a DUI or two in his younger days. A pretty serious lapse in judgement, but again, this can be written off as a pretty common mistake. Crack cocaine, though, is a destructive, dangerous drug with the potential for consequences that far outweigh the intense, brief high that it gives you. This, in my opinion, is such a severe lapse in judgment that I would have to question every decision that person made. I would certainly not trust that person in any form of leadership capacity. Even if I could forgive the crack smoking, the very simple fact remains that in spite of the overwhelming desire of the people that he accept the consequences of his action and relinquish his position, he defies the will of the people and remains in office. He is exploiting a loophole in the law that unfortunately prevents the people from having him removed from office. The only honorable thing left for him to do would be to gracefully step down, even if only in acknowledgement of the fact that that he is a proverbial ""lame duck,"" and will absolutely have no ability to accomplish anything in time remaining in his term.
