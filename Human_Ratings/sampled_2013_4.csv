13825,1,">Yes, these new laws are imperfect, and yes it will take some fine-tuning. But the current DUI protocols for marijuana are even worse. The answer isn't then to enact a new set of laws deviating into another realm of potential incarceration for innocent people. It would be just as worse if not worse than current DUI protocols to enact half ass legislation and ""hope it evolves"" esp when it could cost people money/life/family/general welfare by being prosecuted.

18693,1,"Very long time ago since I've logged into this account, but I just wanted to follow up.My only point was that social attitudes and legal status are an underappreciated part of why certain drugs are perceived of as ""dangerous"" and others are not. This is something that is pointed out pretty insistently (and rightfully so) by those who are pro-marijuana legalization. My only point is that it applies to other drugs too. Insofar as marijuana is dangerous, a large part of the danger is because people *make* it dangerous. Now, there are always going to be some potential negative effects, and some moreso than with other drugs. And I'm willing to admit that meth is probably objectively less healthy than marijuana. But, I think the difference may be exaggerated.I understand the skepticism about my story, and I don't have proof, and I don't really care one way or another if you believe it. The only point was that my parents were divorced, and both were somewhat involved in the drug business. And, my experience from that tells me that it's much more sane and less problematic to society as a whole to sell small bits of meth to responsible college students than to be involved in a large-scale pot operation in areas of California that have gang violence.

24795,1,"I'm not so sure of the relevance of this post to debateacommunist, but I will object to a few things as an economic researcher and graduate student in economics:1)Cost Benefit analysis (cba), a sort-of method to measure efficiency as the author explains, is always relative and not universal. As with all economic analyses, and especially cba, transparency of your assumptions and premises are essential to a complete analysis. Whether an analysis has limitations is important but does not detract from the analysis...as long as you are transparent about the limitations. And, by the way, *all* economic analyses have limitations in scope and application. No analysis will cover ""infinite"" possibilites. So, in reality any and all analyses are relative making that point redundant.2) The notion that cba is purely a ""deterministic ontology"", which I interpreted to relate to Hedonic methods and the straight forward causal interpretation of the variables, is correct. However, I see very little reason to utterly reject it and buy into ""overdeterminism."" After all, when it comes to statistical inference and determining prices, costs, and benefits for any policy instrument...*It's really all we have.* (with the exception of contingent valuation.) The author doesn't really offer any alternative except to throw our hands in the air and say ""efficiency is relative!"" I don't see the practical purpose of overdeterminism regarding cost-benefit analysis.3) The title of the post is just silly. This idea affects capitalists, communists, and any political belief. CBA is a valuable tool for contributing to research surrounding taxation, safety measures, climate change, and even the debate regarding legalization of marijuana. The fact that he disparages it and offers no real alternative serves no purpose but only restrains progress in real economic research.

41949,1,"Marijuana is almost as well understood as wheat. And it has withstood the test of time. No offense, but it seems like you are spouting ""facts"" that you read from a drug pamphlet. I don't understand why Hemochromatosis is not allowed his opinion.It isn't that I look down on drinking, when done responsibly, but he is kind of right. It is a fact that alcohol is highly addictive. It is a fact that alcohol can kill you. Maybe do some research, there are literally thousands of peer-reviewed papers about the effects of marijuana out there. I understand your point, I'm not really trying to talk down to you I just feel like maybe you have not actually done much independent research in this. If you think that FDA approved preservatives and food additives have undergone more extensive testing to determine it is okay for our health, compared to how much similar research has been done on the effects of marijuana, you're kidding yourself. I used to smoke every day, and unlike some little kiddies on /r/trees, I will freely admit that there **are** withdrawal symptoms (though mild) when you smoke frequently. And it is possible to become psychologically dependent on it, which many stoners don't like to acknowledge, but it is true. But the bottom line, nobody has just keeled over from smoking too much weed, and it does not have the physical addiction aspect that alcohol, cigarettes, etc have. So unless you're citing since discredited scientific papers from the 1920s and before, or just giving out information you found on the DEA's website, I really have no idea where you are coming from. Sure weed might have detrimental health effects when used very excessively. But they are negligible when compared to alcohol, so I don't know why this guy isn't allowed his personal opinion. If he doesn't want to be involved with drinking, that should be okay. If you don't want to smoke weed, that's fine too. But the assertion that marijuana has not been studied for many, MANY years and is well understood is just 100% false.**TL;DR Just no.**

76987,1,"I once worked at a gas station on the overnight shift while spending my days in the local jail. I was awaiting a probation revocation hearing in which they were going to throw me in prison for several years because I refused to stop smoking marijuana (I was convicted of a Felony Possession of Marijuana for having a pipe with THC residue inside of it, and served 4 years probation for it, this was towards the end of that probation term). Like I said, I was working at a gas station at the time, the graveyard shift (12am-8am, M-F). It was deserted one morning, around 6:30am or so on a Tuesday, when a cute girl pulled up to the pump and began filling her car. She wasn't coming inside, so I went back to cleaning the floors. I looked up a moment later and didn't see her. I had a clear view of the vehicle, and the pumps, and it took me a moment to notice the outline of something underneath her car like she was laying down. I ran outside and around her car to find her having a seizure. I took off my jacket, balled it up and placed it under her head, then called 911 while trying to hold her arms together to keep her from damaging herself too much. The paramedics arrived and took her away, I reparked her car in a spot out of the way and told my manager when he came in what had happened. 3 Weeks later, I am sitting in court when the new assistant prosecutor comes in to push the case against me. I recognize her. She recognizes me. I had just saved her life, and she postponed the revocation hearing 2 more times over 6 months until I had upset the court enough with the complete waste of funding I had become (over $400k spent on 7 treatment programs, 5 holding facilities, and intensive supervision over a 4 year period, all to convince me to quit smoking pot) that they simply let me go.

So until the day, in the US, where weed can be used legally EVERYWHERE, without the DEA breathing down everyone's neck and harassing dispensary owners, no.

154774,1,"> So, when you register, you don't have to declare for any Party? (We do, but it only restricts our choices in the Primary, not the final.)Correct. Registering to vote is purely to ensure people only vote once (you're not allowed to vote unless your details are on the list, so you can be ticked off once you have voted).> But when you vote, do you get to pick and choose individuals from any Party, or do you have to vote a set of them? (That was what I thought..?) We can do a straight ""Party ticket"" in the final, but we don't have to.It depends on the election. There are at several different sets of elections in the UK and they use [several different procedures](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/how_do_i_vote/voting_systems.aspx). For UK parliamentary elections, you get a list of candidates for your constituency and you select one. For Scottish parliamentary elections, you also get a ""regional list"" candidate - you can vote for a Green MSP for the city you live in, and a Labour MSP for the wider area.The way votes are tallied also varies depending on the election - UK parliamentary elections use [FPTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting), Scottish parliamentary elections use [AMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional_Member_System).> Tonight I had my dad on the phone asking me questions, so I think I will still use it as a starting point, but make sure to say what doesn't really match up.Pick your favourite metaphor, it's probably no worse than any other. :) To my mind there are really three questions:* Could Scotland do it?* Why would Scotland do it?* What would happen if Scotland did it?The *could* is clearly yes, the *why* is where it starts to get a bit fuzzy - every person will have their own opinion.The *what* is not what the referendum is deciding, so you can only really talk in broad strokes. But the parties that are proposing it are all in favour of the western-European-democracy model, so you could expect something similar to Denmark/Ireland/Finland/Slovakia/etc.> No kidding! And not just in terms of the U.K.--for those of us on the outside watching, there are some important philosophical questions involved in terms of what constitutes the most functional form/size of a Democracy. How much control is it worth it to give up, to be part of a larger more powerful entity? How big is too big to really be responsive to all the voters? And so on.>> And yes, these are questions that come up with EU members too--many trade offs involved there as well (but seems like usually it is worth it for most members?)I think so, yes.Parties like UKIP take the opposite line, in that they believe countries should have ""more control"" over their own affairs. On the face of it that sounds good, but the reality is that we live in an interconnected world - there is no such thing as a stand-alone country any more.The UK has had a problematic relationship with the EU for a long time (for the most part confined to the Conservative party, which has a very pro-EU and anti-EU divide within it: UKIP arose out of that). Independence in Scotland would, to my mind, lead to a less antagonistic relationship with the EU than the UK has had in the past.> Certainly. Although with all the hyperbole here sometimes, one might question that bond. But definitely no one in the U.S. thinks of themselves ""I'm Californian first, then American.""Identity is another thing that doesn't travel well in terms of finding comparisons, but it would be quite common to find people in the UK thinking:* I'm Scottish/English/Welsh* I'm Scottish then British* I'm Scottish and British* I'm Scottish and European* I'm British* I'm ""European"" (this is much, much, less common)Even choosing ""then"" vs ""and"" carries an implication… maybe (maybe!) a similar situation might be Native Americans? Perhaps some of them think of themselves as ""I""m Navajo"" while others think ""I'm Navajo, and American"". I don't know - that might be ludicrous, but it seems plausible from the outside.> The U.S. States do have their own legal systems, and laws differ across those borders--medical use of marijuana is a good current example: legal in some, not in others. Legal age for alcohol is another example.As well as differences in specific laws, there are also [two main types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LegalSystemsOfTheWorldMap.png) of legal system: civil law (the written law is definitive) and common law (law is established by precedent). [English law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law) is common law, [Scots law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law) is perhaps more like the US in that it contains both civil and common law elements.> Thanks again for all the details! I think this is really such an important, historic vote that will take place, with ramifications/implications and questions to be raised that go beyond Scotland or the U.K., it is pretty cool to be able to see it somewhat from the inside here. I really appreciate people taking the time to talk about it with the rest of us.No problem - I think it's useful for us too! Irrespective of the result in 2014, I think one of the differences between this referendum and previous attempts is the internet. The arguments that politicians make are now being examined with much more scrutiny than they were in the past, and there is a wealth of information available if you want it.

The argument to keep it legal just benefits organised crime and hinders ordinary people. The massive waste of resources in courts and prisons would be a thing of the past. The tourism sector would explode, every airport in the country would be busier.For the Dutch to propose a ban on foreigners smoking weed would be akin to us banning tourists from pubs.

184361,1,"I have been a heavy, heavy pot smoker for many years. I would smoke from the minute I woke up to the minute I fell asleep, and I have smoked high quality marijuana consistently for years (and so has my fiancé). We have every type of paraphernalia you could imagine and it was/is a big part of our lives. My fiancé is considerably older than I and uses it for other reasons than I do; he is mature enough to not let it effect his life overall, whereas I believe I have an issue with it. I used marijuana to replace the copious amounts of prescription medications I had shoved down my throat (I do not regret this, some I believe were only prescribed because the drug representative had good incentives, and some I got very addicted to and would abuse). Marijuana has been a constant in my life from the beginning, my mother is a huge user and once I became older we would smoke together almost daily. Up until about 3 months into my pregnancy I continued to smoke, but I was depending on the marijuana because I quit cigarettes. I became increasingly more and more anxious and smoking started to give me panic attacks. It did not feel good or right to be doing anymore and I have stopped. I will definitely use it again once I give birth, but definitely not to the extent that I was using. Now that I have been collectively sober for a couple months, I can tell you I see a large change in myself. I am less nervous, anxious, withdrawn, and depressed. Although I was using marijuana to alleviate these issues, the consistent and heavy use over time worsened the issues for me. I honestly cannot remember a day that I did not smoke at least twice. At first I tried to turn a cheek to the guilt I was feeling about smoking weed, but over time I felt worse and worse. If you cannot give up something so petty, that you honestly do not need to stay alive, it is selfish. You are given 9 months where you know your baby (in my case, babies) are safe from harm - no matter the type of harm. Take this chance to completely and utterly devote yourself and your body to doing the best you can because once they are here in the real world there is only so much we can do as parents to protect them. I love weed and I would love to see it legalized and used for positive things, and I know I will smoke after birth, but only then because it is only my body. My babies' cannot consent to this, and as a responsible pot smoker I will never force someone to get high, including my children (no matter how aware they are of it). These are THEIR bodies, not mine, and if they wish to ingest any kind of drug/etc that is their choice, not mine. All in all, it is 9 months. For all of those pro-marijuana, it should not be an issue to be cautious and stop using for only 9 months. I feel if you cannot do that, then you are going against the mantra many pro-pot users say ""you can't get addicted!"" (Physically) - well then, prove it. It is not hard, I promise! Use the time to find other things to indulge in or use to relax.

Even if we're willing to just go with the supposition that illegal activity isn't its primary use (excluding commodity-style trading), the public perception of it alone is bad enough that I think mixing it with the barely legal marijuana industry would, at best create a ton of really bad PR, and at worst paint a huge bull's eye on dispensaries for possible money laundering/tax evasion accusations.I get bitcoin, I've traded it, I watch its price, and I've considered purchasing with it, but I'm still realistic about its use and its mainstream perception. To be totally honest, I don't see why non-digital transactions need to be done with bitcoin; bitcoin was designed to be a digital analog to cash, which already does a pretty good job of being quick and more or less anonymous in the real world (compared to credit card or check). Bitcoin just exists to fill that same niche online.[edit]D'oh I just realized that both of those articles were from too far ago, I was looking for this one:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/19/marijuana-banking_n_4474749.htmlI think your assumption that banks won't be able to work with the industry is very short-sighted. They will inevitably be allowed to operate like legitimate companies, and once this obstacle is gone, what reason would they really have to accept bitcoin? And if these companies were never be allowed something as simple as a checking account, then, bitcoin or not, they're doomed.

206034,1,"Ah gotcha. Thank you for your response.I think I've finally nailed where we diverge in our thought process. The exchange rate conversion you linked to is great, but you've got it bass ackwards. Go back to your Google link on Uruguayan currency and click on the top button. Change it to 'US dollar' (it should be the first option).Google will then calculate a number for you (the ""inverse exchange rate"") that shows one US dollar is worth about $20 in Uruguay. This is the correct exchange rate we have to look at while figuring out our misunderstanding. Here's why (I made the same mistake as you when I took my intermediate international economics course at UCLA a few years ago; luckily it was just a pop quiz and not worth a big part of my grade!):What I am trying to hammer home is the point that a $1 in Uruguay goes a lot farther than a $1 in the US. Switch the exchange rate you calculated back to its original form (the one you linked to). The Uruguayan peso should be on top and the US dollar on the bottom.Google should give you a number like 0.047 (please correct me if I'm wrong). This number tells us that the Uruguayan peso is worth about 5 cents in US dollars. Why did you move the decimal point one place to the right? Again, I did the same thing on a pop quiz as an undergraduate. 20 Uruguayan pesos, by the way, will get you how many US dollars (20 times .05 equals ___)?An eighth of weed for a male college student costs about $40 in California, right? An eighth is 3.5 grams.So one gram in California costs about $12. Thanks to our new understanding of how exchange rates work, we know that one gram in Uruguay, priced by the government at its *illegal* market rate, costs about $20, right?This shows that while Montevideo might have legalized weed, it hardly follows that nobody will be going to jail on account of prohibition. What happens, for example, if drug dealers (also known as entrepreneurs) try to undercut the relatively high price set by Montevideo?PS: It's always nice bumping in to fellow Californians. I do smoke and I live somewhere in northern California, though I love SoCal and Go Bruins!

140163,0,"Copy pasta for those who can't forum: As we have hinted several times before, Marauders are next on the Tech2 to-do list. And guess what? It's feedback time!Marauders were initially released during the Trinity expansion in 2007 and were aimed for PvE activities. However, as time passed and we rebalanced other classes, especially the Pirate Battleships, they lost appeal as a whole.We also believe that designing them for a very specific activity doesn't fit the emergent nature of EVE, and as such we wish to expand their use to PvP as well. Of course, their high price, low mobility will always ensure their role remains a niche one, but we at least can make that purpose more appealing than a simple ""jam me now and forever"" target dummy.As such, after much internal and CSM discussion, we have designed Marauders with two modes of operation, specialized in harassing tactics.In regular mode, they work approximately on the same fashion as on TQ, but are capable of using Micro Jump Drive at a faster rate than usual to quickly relocate on the battlefield.In deployed mode (we call it bastion), their hulls transform (they will have fancy visible animations like the Rorqual does when deploying) and they become fixed weapon placement with a bonus to resistances, tanking, damage projection and receiving EW immunity. However, like Dreadnoughts, they cannot be remote assisted or even move when that happens. They also cannot use Micro Jump Drives in that mode.The combination of both results in a ship that can jump 100km away to quickly react to a shifting environment, then go into bastion mode and use its increased damage application to deal with opposition while absorbing damage. However, due to the lack of remote assistance in that mode and isolating nature of Micro Jump Drives, they will still die easily in larger fights where DPS is concentrated. Remember that the spool up nature of the Micro Jump Drives plus the time needed to align will give opponents a window of opportunity to tackle them before they can jump again.This also provides a stepping stone between sub-capitals / capital and their various siege / triage operation. It is noteworthy to remember we don't necessarily want them to out-damage or go faster than Pirate Battleships - instead, they tank and project damage better.=================================================================================================Before we look at the hulls, here are the details about the Bastion module itself:BASTION MODULEProvides 30% shield, armor and hull resistances when activated, which function on the same way than Damage Control modules (not stacking penalized)Increases shield and armor repair amount by 100%Extends all large turret falloff and tracking by 25%Increases all large missile max velocity by 25%Has a cycle time of 80 seconds. Cycle is reduced by 5% for each level of Bastion module skill to a minimum of 60 seconds.When in bastion mode, Marauder is immune to EW but cannot be remote assisted in any wayWhen in bastion mode, Marauder speed is set to 0 m/s, mass is increased by a factor of 10, cannot warp. Also receives a weapons timer that prevents station docking or gate jumpingOnly one may be fitted per Marauder, cannot be deactivated before cycle endsUses 10 CPU and 100 powergrid to fitUses no specific fuel or capacitor - we were discussing the use of Heavy Water as fuel. However, it doesn't really provide any gameplay (as CCP Rise mentioned, capacitor is the main limiting factor in combat with those ships). Plus it adds more consumables to a class that already commonly uses charges for weapons, cap boosters and need to keep cargo for possible salvaging.BASTION TRANSFORMERTHINGIE™ SKILL(name not final)Rank 8Perception, Willpower as Primary / SecondaryRequires Advanced Weapon Upgrades 5 (that's needed to fly a Marauder anyway)=================================================================================================Giving a new deployed mode is not enough however, as some modifications need to be made on the hulls themselves. First, we wanted to encourage Marauders to use Micro Jump Drives to move around, and as such have reduced mobility next to their Tech1 counterparts (bit higher mass and lower max velocity). We are also reducing their drone bays as they are primarily meant to deliver damage through their main weapon system. They also keep the resistances they have right now instead of gaining full Tech2 resists, otherwise the combination with the bastion module would be quite over the top.However, we realize Marauder hulls have a certain number of issues; as such we are significantly increasing their fittings so that they can fit Large Micro Jump Drives plus Heavy Capacitor Boosters with more ease (the Vargur especially needed more fitting options). We also are increasing their high slots to 8 to compensate for the slot allocation of the bastion mode. We also are increasing their maximum targeting range and scan resolution a bit to make use of the increased damage projection, while decreasing their signature radius.As a final combo bonus, we also are changing Target Painter cycle time from 10 to 5 seconds, and reducing their cap usage to compensate - waiting for the Target Painter cycle to finish before swapping targets is quite annoying on the Golem.Detailed changes below.PALADINRole Bonus: 100% bonus to large energy weapon damage, 100% bonus to range and velocity of tractor beams, 70% reduction in Micro Jump Drive reactivation delayAmarr Battleship Skill Bonus:5% bonus to capacitor capacity7.5% bonus to Large Energy Turret optimal range (instead of 10% bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers per level)Marauder Skill Bonus:7.5% bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems5% bonus to large energy turret damage per levelSlot layout: 8H(+1), 4M, 7L; 4 turrets, 0 launchersFittings: 16500 PWG (+3000), 530 CPU (+30)Defense (shields / armor / hull) : 6300(-500) / 8000(-200) / 7700(+400)Capacitor (amount / recharge rate / cap/s) : 8000(+2375) / 1000s (+76.1s) / 8 cap/s (+2)Mobility (max velocity / agility / mass / align time): 85 m/s(-20) / .119(-0.009) / 111665000(+6465000) / 18.42sDrones (bandwidth / bay): 25(-50) / 50(-25)Targeting (max targeting range / Scan Resolution / Max Locked targets): 91km(+10km) / 120(+39) / 10Sensor strength: 12 RadarSignature radius: 420(-80)GOLEMRole Bonus: 100% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo damage, 100% bonus to range and velocity of tractor beams, 70% reduction in Micro Jump Drive reactivation delayCaldari Battleship Skill Bonus:10% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo velocity5% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo explosion velocity per levelMarauders Skill Bonus:7.5% bonus to shield boost amount10% bonus to effectiveness of target painters per levelSlot layout: 8H(+1), 7M, 4L; 0 turrets, 4 launchersFittings: 8500 PWG (+2000), 715 CPUDefense (shields / armor / hull) : 8000(-200) / 6100(-1200) / 7000(+300)Capacitor (amount / recharge rate / cap/s) : 6325(+700) / 1150s (+226.1s) / 5.5 cap/s (-0.5)Mobility (max velocity / agility / mass / align time): 85 m/s(-20) / .12 / 114195000(+8995000) / 19sDrones (bandwidth / bay): 25(-50) / 50(-25)Targeting (max targeting range / Scan Resolution / Max Locked targets): 95km(+5km) / 105(+32) / 10Sensor strength: 14 GravimetricSignature radius: 450(-125)KRONOSRole Bonus: 100% bonus to large hybrid weapon damage, 100% bonus to range and velocity of tractor beams, 70% reduction in Micro Jump Drive reactivation delayGallente Battleship Skill Bonus:5% bonus to large hybrid weapon damage10% bonus to large Hybrid Turret Falloff per level (instead of 10% bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers per level)Marauder Skill Bonus:7.5% bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems7.5% bonus to large hybrid weapon tracking per levelSlot layout: 8H(+1), 4M, 7L; 4 turrets, 0 launchersFittings: 14000 PWG (+2000), 580 CPU (+30)Defense (shields / armor / hull) : 6600(-200) / 7200(-100) / 8600(+400)Capacitor (amount / recharge rate / cap/s) : 6900(+1275) / 1150s (+226.1s) / 6 cap/sMobility (max velocity / agility / mass / align time): 92 m/s(-28) / .114(-0.0038) / 113160000(+11360000) / 17.8sDrones (bandwidth / bay): 50(-25) / 50(-75)Targeting (max targeting range / Scan Resolution / Max Locked targets): 90km(+3km) / 120(+39) / 10Sensor strength: 13 MagnetometricSignature radius: 420(-80)VARGURRole Bonus: 100% bonus to large projectile weapon damage, 100% bonus to range and velocity of tractor beams, 70% reduction in Micro Jump Drive reactivation delayMinmatar Battleship Skill Bonus:5% bonus to large projectile turret rate of fire10% bonus to large projectile turret falloff per levelMarauder Skill Bonus:7.5% bonus to shield boost amount7.5% bonus to large projectile turret tracking per levelSlot layout: 8H(+1), 6M, 5L; 4 turrets, 0 launchersFittings: 12900 PWG(+5000), 625 CPUDefense (shields / armor / hull) : 7500(-100) / 6600(-200) / 6300 (-1000)Capacitor (amount / recharge rate / cap/s) : 6200(+575) / 1100s(+176.1s) / 5.6 cap/s (-0.4)Mobility (max velocity / agility / mass / align time): 100 m/s(-30) / .112(-0.004) / 116840000(+10740000) / 18.1sDrones (bandwidth / bay): 50(-25) / 50(-25)Targeting (max targeting range / Scan Resolution / Max Locked targets): 81km(+6km) / 145(+60) / 10Sensor strength: 11 LadarSignature radius: 360(-65)

163302,0,"Also, edibles and etc are very expensive comparatively. For people who have their red cards for legit reasons and need constant, several-times-daily medication, it's just not really feasible unless you make metric shit tons of cash. For me, enough weed in herb form to treat my pain costs about $30/week, but edibles would be about $10-15 per DAY. Needless to say, that's REALLY prohibitive to most people. There's also tolerance issues - the longer you take edibles, the more you need, and while that's also true with flower, in my experience, edibles make your tolerance shoot up ludicrously more quickly. So what was once $10-15 per day is $25-30 per day after six months or so. Also, A64 does not provide access to ready-made edibles, and cooking them yourself, if you don't know what you're doing, can be an incredibly expensive learning curve, in which you could easily waste a half ounce of flower or more by accidentally burning off the psychoactive chemicals you're looking for. Non-medical patients, under A64, only have access to flower- no edibles, tinctures, pills, etc, unless they make it themselves. TLDR; Edibles, etc., are expensive, not available to non-medical patients, and somewhat difficult to learn to make, thus making their acquisition and use in lieu of smoke prohibitive to most.

177565,0,"21, Wisconsin (US), I listen to mostly punk, ska, jazz and blues, pretty good movie guess, I'm not sure why I put car in the comment I posted; I guess I was just copying off of the sidebar and accidentally put it. I don't have a car, I live in a city so I bus and bike. Both my parents are alive and separated recently, I'm finishing my undergraduate degree and hope to eventually wind up a criminal defense attorney or a political theory professor, definitely not a liberal if I had to call myself something I would say my political philosophy is more nihilistic anarchism than anything else.Political Science, pre-law degree (I graduate in the spring), I work construction/handy-man type work for now. I plead the fifth on weed and I don't know what mountain boarding is.Nah, definitely wouldn't call myself smug, I probably shouldn't have posted a picture of me smiling, I don't usually smile; I'm not the best judge to tell you whether or not I am nice (probably a little biased) but as far as I know all my friends think I'm nice.

179459,0,"> However, I still feel like skaters get a bad rapUnfortunately, there's just a lot of BS going on in the skateboarding community that's above and beyond statistical averages. Since it's not a race, gender, sexual preference, etc... there's absolutely no discrimination laws OR TRADITIONS protecting you.In my community, the drugs are with the skaters (they were with the fishermen, too, but that's a different story). If a kid skates, he either smokes pot, sells pot, or is the exception with enough guts to say ""no thanks"". Ya'll seem to be really cool with non-conformity, and the no-smoker skaters seem to get treated well..that's great... But it's still hard to get a good image when you're part of a disliked group.I've been there. I was in with the goths for a couple years when it was NOT a smart move (late 90s), and it sucks...but you don't get out of it by not being a true scotsman. The stereotype fits until enough skaters prove otherwise.Face it, you can't completely get rid of all profiling. People will always treat you better in a fancy outfit than torn up jeans. At least in my world, enough skaters are still earning that damn stereotype I don't see a change. However, in my area there's no ""thief"" stereotype for skaters.

192619,0,"I usually run him 4-26 for the sweet CDR. I give up 2 points in tenacity and 2 points enchanted armor. I mean, I can't get too excited about those considering what 5% CDR does for your ulti and cleavers. I figure I lose probably 10 or so armor/MR from not taking those but the CDR helps keep my ulti up near constantly. Build: Liandry's, Sorc Shoes, Spirit Visage, Warmog's, Sunfire Cape, Randuin's/Wit'sEnd/Banshee's/guardian's angel(!) depending on team comp (side note: your ulti works through guardian's angel. Which is super depressing for the other team as you rez at full health and angry). I could see ditching the sunfire if they're like super AP. Cleaver's hit for 37% of current health if you hit a squishy. You can solo drag at 11, probably earlier but it gets risky. You can split push to no end with W+Sunfire+Liandry's. You cannot be dueled. Teemo blind? Okay, guy, cleavers+W still pack a punch. Silence? Okay, guy, E powered attacks still pack a punch. Want to trade? Okay, I have 30+ hp/second regen. Want to engage? I pop ulti while at 25% and heal all the way back up to full health. Want to kite? I throw cleavers and slow you. CC me? W gives me tenacity, good luck buddy. When you play mundo, you farm with cleavers before level 6. You farm with cleavers and your E under tower. You do not engage before level six and you have to be okay with not engaging at all early. Your goal is to get at least 2 items and then you can go where you please. Check bushes with your cleaver. Be very careful early. My skill order is R-Q-W-E but I take a point in E at level 2 to last hit with. Level 11 is your real power spike. The added healing from your ulti is now enough to at least 1v2 and maybe 1v3 them and you should have a few items. Things that hurt you? Ummmm...tryhards before level 6. So like Renek and Riven. Fizz, MF, Vayne and Kog all really suck to fight. Fizz/MF because of the damn bleeds. Vayne/Kog because of the damn % health damage. I've been opening Doran's Shield+pot. The regen on the shield OP. The stopping basic attacks lets you farm easier. The pot lets you recover a bit in the early game. How to beat the mundo? Stand in the minion wave and don't be freaking squishy. I want to cleaver poke you once or twice before I engage. You need to have really strong poke and not just AAs. Shut me down before level 11 for certain and preferably before level 6. Mundo is squishy early. So engage early. I've been spamming mundo. I hope this banning doesn't trickle down.

196920,0,"I think anyone who tries to corner the show into any particular view is probably wrong. It is pro-gay marriage (though makes fun of LGBT's at times), anti-religion (but Jesus is a legitimate hero in the show), anti-republican and anti-democrat (no counter here), pro-smoking (in favor of personal responsibility), pro-tolerance (so that even intolerance should be tolerated), pro-pot, pro-Keynesian economics and anti-US capitalism, pro-first amendment and the list could go on the varied and diverse things they have mocked and insulted.But, that's my view. As to the episode, I don't see it as being about the defeat of the shows only real feminist. They have Wendy breaking down and succumbing to peer-pressure and I don't know a person who watched it who didn't think that was meant to be seen as complete tragedy. Now we might get resolution next season that will clarify the debate (see the midseason 15 finale ""Your getting older"" and the follow up ""Ass burgers"" for what I mean about resolution to a serious question in the show) but I see the trend of the episode to be about the overwhelming difficulty in changing things and how hard it is to not succumb to the norm yourself; that might not be the intent but that's how I saw it. As someone pointed in another post they saw the treatment of the men in the show as Kanye just being stupid jokes and the rest being treated as ignorant but good intentioned fools. But that's not how I saw it, as a cis-male who started my life in a very misogynistic branch of Christianity I saw myself at that time: utterly oblivious to the fact that feminism had valid points and just dismissing it out of hand without any critical thought. The male character that I think most showed signs of evolving into feminist ideas was actually Kanye's. Where at the end he's basically coming to grips that his wife isn't how the media portrays her but he loves her for who she is not what she's made to look like.

199864,0,"""Dick, sit down,"" Peter said- unbuttoning his tuxedo as the guests from the gala left. Dick Grayson, a strong young acrobat in his twenties, felt like he was swaying. That wasn't normal for an acrobat, but he was starting to realize just how much he had drank.""Come on, Mister Parker- do you think we can do this tomorrow?""""No, we need to have a talk,"" Peter Parker insisted, and slowly nudged Grayson down onto the couch. Grayson felt the fine pillows fluff as his frame abruptly fell into them. Albert entered the small guest room with a fresh pot of coffee and a large pitcher of water.""I assume you'll need these,"" Albert remarked in Peter's direction as he placed the tray in between them. Peter nodded to Albert and waited for him to leave the room.""Alright, alright- what did I do? So, I insulted the commissioner? He had it coming,"" Grayson protested.""Commissioner Gordon's got a thick skin. He'll get over it,"" dismissed Peter, and in another moment the fireplace was swiveling on a platform. Dick turned toward the platform and his eyes began to bulge. The silver emblem of a spider sat against a black background proudly, and below it was a small tube. Peter smiled at him slowly as Dick processed this.""That tube leads to the Spider's Web,"" Peter admitted. Dick had already gotten up to inspect the swivel fireplace.""But that means you're..."" Dick trailed off.""When I was young...much younger than you, I lost my parents. You know that- I told you that when you lost yours. But what you don't know is that I chose to cope with that grief through vengeance, Dick. I became...I became Spiderman- I became a predator of criminals. I picked the Spider because it's a symbol of fear, of insidiousness that I could use to strike terror into the hearts of my enemies. And when I chose that path, at first- I only had unbridled vengeance. I only had blind aggression. I see what's happening to you, Dick. I see you lashing out, trying to resolve your fear through vengeance."" Dick's face became resolute, his brow was furrowed and his mouth curled into a frown.""Don't try to change me, Mister Parker,"" Dick commanded.""I'm not,"" Peter insisted. ""I'm trying to help you. The pain, the anger that you feel- you can't just let it flare out of control, Dick. You have to guide it. You have to put it in the right place. I can help you channel your aggression. I can help you turn that vengeance into justice,"" Peter explained. Dick still looked away, but Peter could tell he was handling the words. ""Come on, follow me,"" Peter requested, and stepped into the vacuum tube._____________________________________________Bruce finished his cigarette behind the fence and stamped it out with his romper-stompers. He scratched his shaved head and sighed heavily. *What a shitty life,* he thought. Uncle Ben was such a controlling asshole and his aunt just stood by and watched them argue with nothing to say. No one defended the poor orphan, Bruce Wayne- he was just an asshole with a chip on his shoulder who smoked too much and drank like a fish.""Fuck it,"" Bruce mumbled out loud- flicking the cigarette ash off of his leather jacket and adjusting his scratched up jeans. Julio's low-rider rolled up to the fence and flicked off its lights. He nodded at Bruce and they went to work cutting open the fence. Each body ducked through the severed metal prongs and darted low across the ground toward the medical facility.They waited until the guard’s break and Julio put a pistol to the back of a twenty five year old smoking a cigarette. Bruce was only a nineteen year old punk, but he knew that was old enough not to go to juvee anymore. He hated that Marvin had called him in for a heist job, when he normally just sold spliffs- he wasn't about robbing folks, and definitely wasn't about possibly having to kill anyone. Bruce did *not* like guns. But money was tight, and he knew that Uncle Ben needed the help- even though the bastard was so stubborn.They led the guard through the maze of corridors until they came to the advanced chemical testing lab. The guard opened the door for them. On one side of the room, there were cages and cages of animals, including everything from bats to monkeys. Bruce eyed the bats heavily- wondering why they would choose such an animal for cancer treatment testing.""Well, that's as far as you go,"" Julio said to the guard and pointed the gun toward him. Bruce blanched. This had not been part of the arrangement. They were wearing masks, the guard had no way of identifying them, why did Julio need to kill him? Bruce jumped on Julio and the gun fired off. An alarm triggered and the guard ran. Before he left the room, he threw all the switches on the nearby control panel.Suddenly, all the cages opened up inside the room and a sea of animals flooded out. Bruce looked back. Julio had already darted away, the door locking behind the heavy latino gangster. He smiled insidiously at Bruce and disappeared from sight. Before Bruce could turn back, the colony of bats were flocking around him, scratching him, tearing up his skin. He was on the floor, cowering for life before he passed out. He could see his blood pooling below him.Echoes woke up Bruce as he felt the stiff mattress of a hospital bed below him. Flowers from his aunt sat patiently for his awakening. Uncle Ben's jacket sat on the chair next to him. Bruce gritted his teeth- he had been made. He stood up and felt an intense pain in his abdomen. That fall on the tile had really hurt him. He slowly hobbled to the bathroom and ran the sink. When he looked up, and saw himself in the mirror, most of him was bandaged. Between the bandages, there were scrapes and slashes from the bats. Everything was still echoing around him. He wondered why all the sounds he heard were echoes.In his arms, he noticed something strange...there were little points growing from his elbows and from his wrists. they looked like...wing tips? He shook his arms, thinking maybe it was an illusion. They were still there. He shook them again and suddenly, bat wings launched from the outside of his arms. He was stunned.""Oh shit,"" he said- but when he said it, he heard the words echo off the walls and return to his ears. ""I'm...I'm batman!"" He impulsively ran to the window and yanked it open with the claws that had sprouted from his fingernails. He retracted them with glee and then kicked out the screen, slowly moving himself onto the ledge. As he turned around, a nurse and a cop were entering the room.""What the..."" the nurse gasped as Bruce looked back at her, with his wings extended.""Pretty cool, huh lady?!"" He remarked and dropped out of the window. He tried to fly, but realized it was harder than he thought. The ground rushed up on him quickly and he flapped his arms as hard as he could. he closed his eyes as the ground raced toward him, but before he smacked into it, he felt the air giving way under him and he was able to get some lift. As he climbed into the blue sky, he saw uncle Ben staring at him from his hospital room and remembered what had been told to him a thousand times- an adage that he now knew he had to learn:""With great power comes great responsibility.""

200034,0,"I've said it before, I'll say it again. Very few large operations use organic pesticides/herbicides/fungicidesWe sure as hell don't. Why? because they are cost prohibitive, most of them just don't work that well. Most of that shit is geared towards very small back yard operations. If your doing organic right you don't need it anyway. Healthy plants are much less susceptible to pests. I have yet to meet a weed that can stand up against a set of cultivators.
