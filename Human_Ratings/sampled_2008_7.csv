1,1,"""Seriously, if we brought it back as the naturally growing weed that it is, there would be nothing government could do about it.""i'm pretty sure they'd still arrest you for picking and smoking it. Shrooms grow naturally in cow shit, but that didn't stop cops from busting 4 of my friends in highschool.... those dumbasses. hah.
"
2,1,"Yup. I reject the premise that downmodding means I do not want to legalize marijuana. I do not have enough information to make an informed opinion at this time, and I reject the idea that I am forced to participate in upmoding or downmoding simply because I do not wish to see it on Reddit's front page. It goes against the whole point of upmod and downmod in Reddit.
"
3,1,"We need to legalize home growing. Tax only sales and keep all sales taxes low, for they are regressive (tax the poor at a higher rate than the rich). And forget the so-called sin taxes. There's no such thing as sin and there shouldn't be extraordinarily high taxes on alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana.
"
4,1,"""This morning, I was in the coat room at my local legislature, where we were going to talk about pot legalization, and this hot chick walks in, with nothing but a 'legalize pot' t-shirt...""
"
5,1,"Since when is marijuana decriminalization a popular stance in America? It might be in the college campuses but most of the nation is still conservative and prudish. If anything this will hurt his chances of being elected.
"
6,1,"I agree. I am not saying the law is always right. I am saying that if there is no one to enforce the good laws, we will all be victims of no enforcement at all. Societies DO NOT exist without structure. Part of that structure if enforcement to certain standards, even if some of them may be bad. We work to change those standards through political processes if they are wrong, and in some extreme cases through violent measures.All cops are not bad! Some cops have spoken out against the drug laws!!! Some cops (and you may not even know this) refuse to arrest people with a bag of weed in their possession. That shit doesn't make the 8 o'clock news!Cops are not the fucking problem, our elected politicians are.
"
7,1,"Would they need to resort to theft if their habits were treated as medical problems instead of crimes?Society pays one way or another, so if that's the main complaint, it's best to go with the least cost alternative, which is usually legalization.And of course, debilitation doesn't happen with all drugs, nor with all people. Many people are able to consume mass quantities of beer and still support their families. Many more are able to drink responsibly and actually find that alcohol enhances their productivity.The case for cannabis is similar. There's no reason to think that cannabis legalization would result in millions of debilitated users who can only steal to support their habit. Same thing goes for coca tea, or coca leaves.It's not so clear with heroin, though there are many smack addicts who lead productive lives as long as they get enough to keep them ""normal"".Meth looks like it's the only recently popular drug that really destroys people no matter what, though I took some many years ago as a youngster and it didn't get me hooked the way people claim.
"
8,1,"If this is an important issue for you, then you should be supporting Ron Paul:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1009One of the few politicians to actually take a stand and introduce legislation to legalize hemp for agriculture.
"
9,1,"Except that to get there you must still pass through the Dubai legal system. Think of London without rain and taxes *and the possibility of four years in jail because you stepped on a spliff roach*.
"
10,1,"Ah. When I was in Cleveland a few months ago, there was a bar next to Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield that was completely failing to enforce the ban. It wasn't a total dive, but not a real nice place either. All the other bars seemed to be complying.Columbus was another story entirely, but I haven't been there in about 2 years, so it very well may have changed. Most of them hadn't even bothered to remove the ash trays. Then again, these were the same bars that had homeless guys in them trying to sell suspicious white pills and what they claimed was marijuana.Interestingly, there are also a few strip clubs in Columbus that use the ""membership"" idea that someone else mentioned in another comment. Basically, you pay a hefty cover charge the first time you go, they make you a member, and you're allowed to bring your own beer, and they stay open till 5 or 6 in the morning.
"
11,1,"I am surprised that the suspect said nothing about the 'planted' drugs like ""WTF?!?! I DIDN'T HAVE THAT!"" Instead he continues to complain about the dog.<edit>Now that the suspect has admitted having pot, and cops say they found pot in his car, that would explain his lack of surprise. Maybe they planted the dope on him before they found his real stash. It does not look to me like they found that pot in the car like they said, but in his pocket.
"
12,1,"Yes, it was in the freaking article. It is the same with America where there are entire divisions of police departs just for hunting down pot smokers/dealers instead of criminals that actually harm society.
"
13,1,">No, we don't have the power. Politicians do.And who puts the politicians there? Who has the power to demand action from those same politicians?Please don't say Diebold -- any more cynicism today and I will die.I'm not going to engage in baseless speculation -- a judge decided based that the evidence merited a second look. The search went fairly well -- as I detailed in our other thread, your baseless allegations that the police busted their way in(they didn't) and tore the house up looking for pot(they didn't) were refuted. But that won't stop you from speculating, will it?
"
14,1,"If someone actually gets a marijuana case to trial and you say you think the law is just they're not going to come after you for perjury, end of story. Worst case scenario is you get kicked off the jury when they see your picture from the last NORML protest.
"
15,1,"This guy is an idiot. It is obvious that you might not like the law you are convicting someone under, you might even consider it to be un constitutional or in breach of human rights (the EU equivalent) but you simply decide if they broke it or not. If the defendant wants to challenge the law then he does that to a judge and keeps doing it all the way up to the supreme court if he needs to. You just have to decide if he broke the law, not if the law is fair, or reasonable or nice or efficient or if you like it. I have smoked weed in my time but if I were on a jury and someone came up for possession I would have to convict whether I liked it or not, even though I disagree with the law. Would it be ok to convict a guy who was obviously innocent of whatever he was charged with just because you did not like the look of him? The whole point of the law is that you are found guilty or innocent because you break it (or don’t) not because people sort of think what you did was nice or not. Plus unless that cocaine was home grow in Boston, supplying it falls under the commerce clause anyway! and if someone did appeal and win it as unconstitutional then I don’t think there would be any problem re-banning cocaine either by Constitutional amendment or in state legislatures or better still both.
"
16,1,"> ""He interacts with kids on a daily basis, and he is taking a position to decriminalize marijuana. That is counter to logic, in my view.""Man, this guy is a regular Einstein. He should win the Nobel Prize in Logic.
"
17,1,"Fair enough. I'm sure you understand your own situation better than I ever could. I just can't really relate to your experience, nor do I think most marijuana smokers could.I guess I don't deny that it is possible to become addicted to marijuana, or to anything else for that matter. I do think that the potential for addiction to marijuana is MUCH lower than for a lot of other substances, many of which are legal. I also think that the government spends money on marijuana addiction more as a political ploy than to actually help people in situations such as yours.Anyways, good luck!
"
18,1,"It doesn't go far enough. All pot posession should be decrimed, not just small amounts
"
19,1,"Also, if weed were legalized, far more people would be buying it then growing it, and it would be very, very heavily taxed.
"
20,1,"...and people think marijuana will ever be legalized? Pretty soon we'll be fined for not eating FDA approved meals.
"
21,1,"It has everything to do with what happened. This POS was released because of overcrowding of prisons. We have the highest incarceration rates of ANY nation. Many are non-violent drug offenders. This smuck wasn't. So, to make space for a pot head, he was released and predictably assaulted someone.
"
22,1,"sources please... i'm pretty sure you just made all that stuff up or sensationalized it. Every time i've heard him talk about gun issues he's been reasonable and doesn't want to talk your guns away from you.He does want to end the drug war. He's talked about legalizing pot.He said he would talk with leaders of hostile nations... peace comes thru dialog not bombs... so it's a start.i dunno about the 503c thing so i can't comment.dunno about the Codex Alimentarius thing either.I'd personally like to see prostitution legalized and regulated too. I think it would cut down on street crime. It won't work tho if drugs are still illegal.. They go hand in hand. Amsterdam seems to have the right idea... altho maybe overkill there because it's a tourist thing... if every nation was like that it wouldn't be such a mecca. Everything would be more chill and casual. Normal.
"
23,1,"actually, i remember a LOT of people at the time telling me that there was no difference between Bush and Gore so they either didn't vote or they voted for Nader. Never forget that the Republican core will ALWAYS vote in a block. Gun's n' Jesus n' Creationlism n' BigBiz, yeeehaww... They are NOT liberal thinkers. Liberal thinkers have to try to come together to agree on something or else you are going to get the default: NeoCons. A perfect example: Republicans have already picked their guy flat out and the republican base has rallied behind McCain. So while democrats are shooting themselves in the foot with the Hillary vs. Obama thing the Republicans are gaining momentum with McCain. It's part of the party doctrin. Unite behind your guy for the good of the party. If you would like to see liberal and democratic values at the presidential level you have to unite behind the party and not ""sit this one out"" Politics is a team effort. Even if you don't agree with them completly consider which of them is most likely to be a close aproximation of what you would like. If the answer is ""none, i hate them all"" then ask yourself. Which of them would leave the country in a state where you would expect that in the next election your ideas would be closer to center or further to margin. I want transparent government, civil liberties, sane monitary policy, and no war, I'd also like to see pot legalized, the income tax repealed, and prostitution legalized, help the environment too. With Obama I don't expect to get all of that but what I do see is that with Obama i would get: transparent government, sane monitary policy, civil liberties improved, no war. I don't expect to see pot legalized, but perhaps decriminalized. I don't expect to see prostitution legalized. I don't expect the IRS to go away either. But with an Obama presidency I think the field will be set for the future where things like marijuana legalization and income tax reform can be issues that are brought to the front of future presidential campaigns. With McCain i can expect to see more war and reckless spending... no chance in hell of civil liberties being restored and very secretive government. Under McCain it would go farther away from my hopes of marijuana legalization and income tax reform, prostitution, while used most often by republicans, would continue to remain illegal and be less of a debatable issue. See... it matters who you vote for because you are setting the country down a path that may not be perfectly exactly what you hope for but it opens doorways along that path that lead to things that you might want to see happen. One path leads closer to your ideals the other path leads farther away.
"
24,1,"It is a very misleading quote. The reason that the ENTIRE area is not cut is not because of the road, but because of legal easements for it. The logging company doesn't actually own those 10 feet on either side of the road. It's still a sad state of affairs. Support legalization of hemp and end wood pulp paper manufacturing for good!!!
"
25,1,"I do not think it is absurd to make plants illegal.For example, kudzu is an invasive and destructive species. that does half a billion in damage every year. Unrestricted private ownership is dangerous, and so it is illegal. This is a good thing.The argument that ""marijuana grows naturally, and therefore should be legal"" is fallacious.
"
26,1,"oh god here we go, i actually lean a little more towards the side that some drugs are illegal for economic reasons and others because of the conveniently large proportion of blacks, hispanics, and other minorities who used them at the time they were made. Drugs laws used to be a lot harsher and then all the sudden they were like ""oh fuck, foley!!, is that a white man smoking reefer?!!!, jesus we can't send a white man to jail for 20 years""""In 1958, Virginia's Uniform Drug Act was further amended to make the ""possession of illegally acquired narcotic drugs [which included marijuana] in any quantity greater than twenty-five grains(thats 1.62 grams people), if in solid form, or eight ounces, if in liquid form,"" a crime punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000 and imprisonment for not less than twenty nor more than forty years.97 The effect of this enactment was to provide a penalty for illegal possession that was more than twice as severe as the penalty for unlawful sale and one and one-half times more than that for sale to a minor""I have this feeling that not many white people were convicted under that law.
"
27,1,"Wow, didn't expect my comment would be misinterpreted so. Maybe I'm still baked from lighting up at city hall yesterday. Here's my point, put simpler: either the cops fail or the law fails. The number of people breaking the law is irrelevant if the law may not be broken. If 10 000 people were murdering each other, I'm pretty sure the cops wouldn't have shrugged it off by saying they were outnumbered.Yes, I smoke pot, yes, that makes me a criminal, because it is a crime. When it is not a crime I will not be a criminal and yet I will not have changed, interesting, huh?
"
28,1,"> Just pass it already, we Canadians almost had legal pot, but it got stopped cause of your damn American lobbying.It’s only a matter of time. The senate has countless times called for decriminalization, the canadian association of police chiefs also is pushing for decriminalization (but, oddly enough, the police association are against decriminalization).It’s only the US arse-kissing, brownnosing tories who are the stumbling block.
"
29,1,"EVERYTHING is illegal in the U.S.A.American? No cannabis for you!American? No public drinking for you!American? No gatherings allowed ""without a permit""!And so on and so forth. I could write a list of a thousand of these if I had the time.
"
30,1,"Half a million. I believe that's roughly one-sixth or so of the total prison population.How would the situation be improved if 16.5% of all occupied prison beds in the nation suddenly became available?And that sudden 16.5% vacancy doesn't even touch upon the other benefits you mentioned, such as turning cannabis into a revenue stream for the government, instead of a revenue drain.It's a real shame it will **never** happen. This society we find ourselves trapped within has far too much to lose by legalizing cannabis.
"
31,1,"The interesting corollary with prohibition is that it took a Constitutional amendment to instate alcohol prohibition, but not marijuana. It's just another example of the slow leak of power away from the people to the federal government.
"
32,1,"classifying marijuana as an ILLEGAL DRUG surrounds the user with the world of ILLEGAL DRUGS.when prohibition was in effect, drinking took place at speak-easys, the same sort of underground setting that lawmakers are relegating marijuana users to.if you ask me, making marijuana illegal makes it MORE LIKELY to be a gateway drug by surrounding the user with people (drug dealers, their clientèle, and those who do use harder drugs) more likely to influence their choices negatively.
"
33,1,"What's all this ""might be gentler on pot clubs"" crap? Ron Paul, if he was able to from just the executive branch (thankfully he can't), would just get rid of the drug laws all together. Beat that, ""progressives"".
"
34,1,"""California's medical marijuana law clearly sets out that making a profit selling marijuana is illegal"" What is the basis of this? Why would they want to make it illegal to make a profit from selling medicine? I mean, if you're thinking of it like aspirin, I don't see why you'd put in such a clause.
"
35,1,"It's fair enough to ask. My reasoning is like this:* We (gov't, 'responsible' adults) pronounced all 'drugs,' from pot to heroin, equally evil. Unfortunately, some kid tries pot, realises it's not as bad as he was led to believe, and wonders if that applies to all drugs. Legalising the not-harmful-if-used-in-moderation drugs gives you some legitimacy when you ban some others.* We (society) end up paying a heavy price for the addictive drugs I mentioned. Therefore we have a right to restrict their use. * Allowing people to use the other stuff may give many people enough kicks that they can live without trying the really dangerous stuff.* Kids. If my kids try mushrooms or pot, well, ok. But I really want to make the hard stuff hard to come by. Granted, there will always be self-destructive people who will become alcoholic, chain-smoking, hop heads. But you can't help people who don't want to be helped.
"
36,1,"Bear in mind if pot was legal, you would not have to smoke it- you would make cookies.There's a VERY high chance that any damage is caused by the smoke- not the active ingredients in cannabis.you can bet your ass the pharmaceutical companies paid for this -*translation: it was faked*- and the next step will be to piss test your child for marijuana use in school and then make them take some pill they have cooked up to prevent psychosis.Another thing of note is that commercial growers of marijuana use massive amounts of pesticides indoors and this study failed to test for that in the weed these guys were smoking- again- make it legal- and remove this chemical damage.Also of note is watching television causes much more brain damage.http://www.theage.com.au/news/science/the-idiot-box/2005/10/03/1128191629304.html
"
37,1,"> ...deciding whether or not to stop lighting up and start growing up has become a dilemma for more than one arrested adolescent on screen.It's a little sad that they present it like such a dichotomy. The portrayal of marijuana as a pastime solely enjoyed by the stupid and young gives the opponents of its legalization a quick and easy way to write it off entirely. If they can disregard legalization advocates as immature kids who haven't learned life's most important lessons yet (which many apparently believe to be obedience, strict lawfulness, and arbitrary restraint), they gain an undeserved upper hand in the debate.The article makes a valid point about the introduction of marijuana into society, but rarely do these films ever seem to actually portray it as a socially acceptable and normal thing that stable, productive adults do. The day a movie comes out with such subtle pot use that only the strongest of fanatics even notice will be the day that we have reached a level of sanity and rationality that, were it not for extremists and political opportunists, we could have been maintaining for decades.
"
38,1,"> So, why is it bad again?Because someone long ago decided that drinking yourself to death and giving yourself lung cancer from smoking is perfectly legal but smoking weed, which is much less harmful to your body than alcohol and tobacco on a per-consumption basis, is ""bad"".

Yeah, he's out there, but he is super fun to fuck with.
"
45,1,"Stay out of jail. If you have a California or elsewhere license, grow it somewhere outdoors, near water, 5 gallon bucket with holes and good soil in it, dug into the ground, plenty of sun. It's a weed and grows like one. The key is good stock. Toss on some bat guano when its time to bud.
"
46,1,"how is this landmark? >As opposed to previous efforts in other states, the Massachusetts initiative does not seek to remove all penalties for marijuana posession, but instead treat it as a minor infraction, punishable by a ticket and small fine.In Minnesota up to 1.5 ounces is a misdemeanor punishable with up to a $200 fine
"
47,1,"Not if you consider that, at least in theory, the legislators are bound by the same laws as everyone else. Whether it brings them money or not, it could mean life-destroying pain and disability should they ever get one of the many diseases for which marijuana provides relief. Not only themselves, but they are dooming their family and friends and such to the same fate. More cancer, more pain, more nausea, more anxiety, more migraines, less enjoyment of life all around... for a few bucks? I don't think they could present their case as rationally consistent.
"
48,1,"So, let me get this straight:Legal restrictions and restrictions of necessity on the amount of pot anyone can grow means that the market polices itself? So because of the shady nature of the market, and the partial legality keeping prices relatively low (so that criminals do other things which get them more money), the people who produce the merchandise actually care about what they're doing, so they do it well. Yes?Imagine that. Maybe we should make it so that no business can be over a certain size.

"
51,1,">The action comes on the same day an appellate court in San Diego rules that federal law does not preempt California's medical pot law.Y'know, the whole reason we have states is so that the federal government cannot do shit like this.

If you don’t like the man, don’t vote for him! But badmouthing his sacrifices is just plain silly. Obama admitted to using alcohol, marijuana and cocaine during his teenage years. And apparently that makes him more worthy to be president of the USA than a man who served his country and endured torture and suffering to defend it. As I have said before, seen from Europe, Americans are pretty weird.
"
53,1,"If the law says ""you can't have marijuana"", and I say I can uphold that law, then I'd be lying.I'd like to be able to do nullification, but I'm not going to lie. I'd rather just make a big deal about how I disagree with the law and get thrown out of the courtroom than lie my way onto the jury.
"
54,1,"While slightly obnoxious, you have a good point.All 'the state is inherently invalid/corrupt/whatever' arguments aside, I would trust a judge to know the law and enact it coldly and fairly more than* a 'jury of my peers', particularly when it comes to the media biasing people. Note jurors' propensity to go easy on famous people. Or, as you pointed out, letting klan members go. And the end of the day, I'd rather be subject to cold law than cultural perceptions and biases, and judges are better suited to do that than juries.*(Note that I said 'more than', not 'completely'. Judges are of course human, and therefore not free of bias or stupid decisions.)Having juries as safe guards for stupid laws is far from ideal. The obvious solution is for the people to have more say in the law and how it is enforced.If the majority of people want marijuana legalised, than by all means it should be legal.
"
55,1,">That juries are the trier of fact is a well know aspect of the jury system. If you did not know this and/or disagreed you could have asked for support.That was never in dispute, I challenge you to point out where I ever claimed juries were not ""triers of fact"" and thus was in error on this point. My claim is that they are more than just tries of fact.>OK, that was not chutzpah, I simply knew what I was talking about.Do you? I can supply a dictionary definition of the role of a jury from no less an athority than Noah Webster himself:- *Petty juries,* consisting usually of twelve men, attend courts to try matters of fact in civil causes, and **to decide both the law and the fact in criminal prosecutions.** The decision of a petty jury is called a *verdict.* -Noah Webster, *Dictionary of the English Language,* 1828Quid pro quo on the definitions. I would note that mine is dated 1828... where's all that necessary discussion you alluded to when the radical change came?>So I went back to read the context. Adams speaks of a law against the ""fundamental principles"" of the Constitution. Not some ""I don't like the law"" or ""I don't think this should be illegal"".A law prohibiting the simple possession of marijuana would be exactly the type of law Adams was referring to, likewise I have every reason to believe the ""felony homicide"" law as it was applied in my jury trial would have also been considered unconstitutional by Adams and thus subject to nullification. And your characterization of a juror saying ""I don't like the law"" is rather childish and once again ignores the use I've been cited, ie. ""This law is being applied in an **unjust** manner."" Jurors should not be treated like children, it isn't about what they like or dislike, but rather their sense of fairness... of justice being served. Again: juries represent the conscience of the People, as was clearly the intent of the founders. Let's hear from another one:- Jurors should acquit, even against the judge's instruction...if exercising their judgement with discretion and honesty they have a clear conviction that the charge of the court is wrong. -Alexander Hamilton, 1804Is there anything you don't understand about that statement? Hamilton didn't say ""exercising their judgement *on a whim*"" he said ""with discretion and honesty they have a clear conviction that the charge of the court is wrong."" Are you arguing that a jury should act without ""discretion and honesty?"" Is that the system you would wish to be tried under? One where a law is being abused to unjustly charge you with a crime you should not be held accountable for, but for which the judge all but orders the jury to find you guilty of, despite their conscience telling them ""this is ABSOLUTELY WRONG?"" I know this much, that was not the intent the founders had for juries, and anyone who tells you different is either misinformed or lying.>Furthermore, this brings us back to my original point: the juror in question got the Constitution wrong. Standing up for false fundamental principles is rather silly.You can't possibly be suggesting that because of some juror's mistake that jury null is now invalidated? Now that would be ""rather silly."" It is also a strawman argument which has no bearing on any of the points I have made... do you see where I've made any reference to him? No? Move on.>That sure seems like a claim that the role of the jury was to decide the law, not the facts. That, absent the jury deciding the law, it served no purpose.Not at all. What it meant was that absent the jury being able to disregard a judge's instructions, they serve as little more than a rubber stamp for the state, especially since it is the state that decides which facts can be entered into evidence. The judge can explain the finer points of the law, and most juries will understand what is told to them. What they must do next is determine if, in the case before them, the law is being applied justly or unjustly. Do you see the difference? One can completely accept a judge's interpretation of a law along with the facts in evidence and still conclude it would be a travesty of justice to find the defendant guilty. That is what a well informed jury should be doing, unfortunately most juries today are not informed. The jury I was on sent a note to the judge during deliberations specifically asking about what powers we had in this regard, the judge completely dodged the question by replying with a terse: ""Follow the jury instructions."" No guidance, just a flat out command to do what we had been told... couldn't tell us the truth and didn't want to risk a lie.>And that somehow how my disagreement about nullification meant that I suppose an all powerful state.No. I wasn't implying you WANTED an all powerful state, I was implying that is what you might get if you didn't support jury null. Likewise, you could say ""let's do away with all checks and balances and just trust the President to do the right thing."" That wouldn't mean you wanted a despotic president, but I would suggest it would lead to one, in the same way your denial of jury null weakens the last check citizens have over their government. Well, second to last anyway.>And then you got pissy when I objected.I got pissy after the frivolous ""trifecta"" quip. I've seen some of your other debate threads and I seriously doubt you would let anyone else get away with a remark like that. As they say: ""What's good for the goose..."">How is having a jury as the trier of fact totalitarian?How do you manage to so thoroughly misrepresent what I was saying? You must have some kind of weird gift. Having a jury try facts does not lead to totalitarianism. But juries need to be more than mere fact checkers if the state is going to be prevented from applying laws in an unjust manner. I'm really getting weary of repeating that over and over.>How is wanting to have legal reasoning done in the light of day and subject to discussion and approval totalitarian?Are you suggesting that juries should be forced to deliberate (ie. do their ""legal reasoning"") ""in the light of day"" and then be subject to ""approval?"" If not, then what are you asking? And if so... you really can't figure out for yourself how that could lead to totalitarianism? Seriously?

If driving to BC is too big a pain, Ontario and Quebec are reasonably close to you, and the weed will be just as amazing (and way cheaper than you're used to).I moved to Canada from the US a little over a year ago. I wish I would've done it sooner. if you have any liberal/libertarian leanings, this country will blow your mind.

64,1,"What happens where I live in Maryland is if you do not consent to a search they will call in the dogs. Every single day in our local paper are the arrests of young pot smokers who were caught for a broken tail light and searched by a dog. Almost every single incident of catching someone with marijuana is because of a license plate light out or a tail light out. It has caused a lot of people to joke about it but where we live being arrested for pot is a HUGE deal. We have gangs and shootings and car thefts...but it is the pot-heads they are after. It becomes laughable if it wasn't so pathetic. I am sick of pot arrests. Wasted funding IMHO. Then again doesn't the amount of drug arrests help with receiving more funding for the department? It is easier to catch a pot-head than an illegal prescription drug user.

That, and it was in response to his opinion in the first place that I asked. >Yes, you should in-fact be arrested for smoking pot in your home?

Changing marijuana laws isn't exactly the change he's emphasized during his campaign. I would definitely not mind, however, if his administration got to decriminalization after succeeding (I hope) with some of the more pressing changes. It would also give time for marijuana decriminalization to become more popular (again, I hope) across the nation. Then decriminalization would be more a will of the people type of policy rather than because the president is a pothead (not something I'd consider an insult... but I'm not president). The success of this election's ballot questions on marijuana gives me hope that it will happen eventually - except, WTF California? Heh.

80,1,"Yes, well, I was mostly equating this:>possession promotes its production, at least indirectly.to>pot is a gateway drugin the sense that neither is backed up by any sort of conclusive and non-biased studies. It is the same situation as the various IP organizations (music, movies, games) saying that piracy costs them X billion dollars a year. Even if the numbers are inflated it is the logical conclusion, yet when one studies the issue, they find that the truth is more nuanced, and also mostly counter-intuitive and the damage is certainly not what is portrayed.So you have a case where one wants to legislate morality, claims intuitive harm without proof, and in its narrow focus attacks a relatively minor problem with over zealous action resulting in a lot of unintended collateral damage.

They do that stuff in the evidence gathering stage of your case when you've already had one of the above list of items get their attention.>how hard is it to grow enough to produce enough for yourselfI don't know much about marijuana, but a friend grows indoor tomatoes and gave this advice:Obviously it depends on your consumption habits, but not very. If you eat an ounce of high quality tomatoes a month, then you could easily grow under a 250-400w light and have plenty. If you eat an ounce a week or want to share with family/friends, you will probably want to go 1000w. Above that you are storing for a natural disaster.You can get by with one or two plants really. They will grow to the available light. A common mistake is to 'overgrow' your space with excessive numbers of plants, or by letting them get too big in the vegetative phase of growing. They will often double in size when you switch to the flowering stage and start hitting your lamp. This is dependent on the specific plants genetics, and usually takes a cycle or three to get comfortable and 'dial in' your space for your strain.One of the biggest issues is ventilation. A 1000w light is HOT. Even a 400w light puts off a lot of heat. This is regional, of course. Growing in Arizona is a lot more heat intensive than growing in Nova Scotia.It is a fucking shame that Overgrow.Com is no longer around. That place was the holy grail of information on the subject. Start small, have fun, do your homework, and keep your fucking mouth shut and you will have your own private stash of world class tomatoes that you never have to search, travel, or interact with shady motherfuckers to get. Eat your big juicy tomatoes and you don't have to sweat it because you didn't pay $125 for a 1/4. When you get the hang of it, be sure to get the bubble bags so you can make some killer salsa out of your trimmings. Really hard to beat! mmmmmStay safe!

85,1,">Also, any semi-proficient lawyer would look at the warrant if weed WAS found (and this was a criminal trial), and even then they would notice that there wasn't probable cause. I don't know what the judge was thinking.I believe forfeiture laws in some states allow the police to seize ""drug-related' property independent of the results of any criminal trial (if there is one at all). As I understand it, the forfeiture is not a prosecution as such, so I'm not sure to what extent probable cause would apply. Again, I don't know, and I'm not a lawyer [yet], but that might well explain why they'd be so happy to go in with an obviously faulty warrant.

91,1,"Well, legally, that headline is inaccurate. What actually happened is that the Supreme Court refused to review a CA state ruling that *California's* medical marijuana law *is not preempted by* federal laws. The Supreme Court didn't agree to anything, and it doesn't mean that another state's law--if different--could not be preempted.Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, state laws that contradict federal laws are preempted. The CA court in this case just decided that CA's law didn't contradict Federal law. The Supreme Court simply declined to review the decision, and there could be any number of reasons besides the fact that they agree with the lower court's ruling.

92,1,"I think that depends on whether or not you are caught actually buying what you believe to be illegal narcotics or whether you are only found to be in possession of what you believe to be illegal narcotics.Just as dealers can be prosecuted for selling catnip if they are selling it as marijuana, if you are caught in the process of buying said catnip because you thought it was marijuana then you're still guilty of attempting to buy marijuana.

93,1,"I'm talking about people who don't want some nebulous governmental entity dictating behavior to them. I'm not necessarily talking about people who would proactively go out and violently try to free themselves from the rule of a governing body because they felt that they weren't being duly represented (although that is what the founders of America did, and they are generally considered to be great people, so maybe I am talking about those people too).It is a matter of perspective. The [mujahadeen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahadeen) are a good example, freedom fighters to some, terrorists/insurgents to others.Another example is the drug war, some people think that smoking pot is better than the 'acceptable' alternatives of alcohol or cigarettes, yet their lives are routinely destroyed by a governing body out of control on a distorted sense of righteousness. That overzealous behavior of government may scale up to a global government, and some people wouldn't want that, but wouldn't be able to affect change in such a large bureaucracy's laws. So they would be labeled as terrorists/insurgents and gone after with full military force, even if they were doing no harm.I guess I'm suggesting that the warrior mindset is the problem with our species.

99,0,"i agree that there is a brain. that lsd effects the chemical reactions in the brain but as consiquence of this an interesting thing happens. YOU are still there aware of the change. you don't suddenly become different. Your moods, thoughts, and actions do. but you remain constant throughout all of it. Again, I can't really explain it to you unless you try it. I have never had a flashback and I have done LSD over 400 times. When I was younger (16 or so, 31 now) I used to do LSD 2-3 times a weekend every weekend. Then one day I just decided I had had enough. It wasn't an addiction thing, it was an exploration of consciousness. Fascinating new discoveries were being made about the nature of the universe. Some people abuse it and use it as a party drug, i think that is totally missing the point. I can understand your fear of ""messing up"" your brain chemistry, but I can honestly say that as long as you are conscious, clear, rational individual you will be perfectly fine. It always wears off. Even when you wish it wouldn't. If you have an predisposition to mental disorders though I wouldn't recommend doing it though. I have experianced so many amazing things while on LSD and afterwords while sober but meditating. I have experianced: Out of body, God Awareness, dimensional shifting, seeing through walls, hearing a friends thoughts without them speaking, projecting my thoughts into another without speaking, speaking with animals, out of body flight, stillness & oneness with everything, peace and harmony. Then there is a dark side too: fear and paranoia all from being around very negative people who project their dark thoughts and vibrations. Tripping in public and seeing a cop is freaking terrible. I recommend you try it at least once in your life. You will most likely have a positive experiance, and your chemistry will be just fine. Again, as much as I have done it i have had ZERO flashbacks. A friend of mine who has done it over 1500 times has also had zero flashbacks. I think people who have flashbacks are people who supress things in their life. If you suppress anything in life it's going to come back up later. LOL, a flashback would be fun! :) If you've never done anything though I recommend shrooms and/or pot. They are natural and less intense.

100,0,"There are idiots who cause freak accidents anywhere you go. The guy who shot his wife is one. It could have just as easily been some other stupid move like the guy who blew up his house huffing propane while smoking pot a couple years ago. The US has a lower rate of death caused by accidental shooting than France (0.36 per 100,000 for the US, 0.49 per 100,000 for France). There aren't enough people being hit by random bullets for it to be something that one should be worried about.The Anwan guy lives in the one spot in the US where guns are effectively illegal.Parts of the US are safer than England. In the northeast the murder rate for the region is almost as low as the UK and other crime is much lower. As a whole nation the US has lower overall violent crime rates than the UK. Yes, we have a high murder, but we have less assaults. Since a person is more likely to be assaulted or robbed than murdered, it can end up safer living here in the US.
