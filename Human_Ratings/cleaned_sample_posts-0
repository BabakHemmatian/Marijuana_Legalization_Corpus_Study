I think if enough states legalize or decriminalize marijuana for recreational use then the federal government will eventually legalize it before all the states get around to it. but idk if or when this would take place or what would have to happen...

This is how the leadership campaign is going to work though. It's going to be complete chaos for the next little while as the party selects a new leader. Leadership contenders are going to take opposing issues in things like marijuana laws etc.>They need to remove the ultra-right evangelical elements of their party, or they are dooooomed.I don't disagree but I reject the claim that the statist, big government social conservatives in the party are ultra-right. Left / right to me is an economic scale. I'm pretty far right on fiscal issues but I also am pro-choice, pro gay marriage, pro legalization, and pro assisted dying. That doesn't make me a centrist. It makes me an actual small government conservative. Keep an eye on the convention in May to see what sides of the party are winning the influence battle. There's lots of Bell weather issues that are going to be debated.

Lolwut. Knowing a specific fact proves no kind of higher knowledge or intelligence, it shows you know how to use google. Try again. Knowing random specific facts about weed is not going to make anyone think any different about it. Otherwise weed would be legal. The facts are largely irrelevant and do not speak for themselves.

For sure drunk driving is worse than high driving. All I am saying is that there is an obvious way to combat drunk driving: roadchecks. You drive drunk, cops make you take a breathalyzer test, and you're not driving any more for a while. As far as I know, no such technology exists for marijuana, so driving high would be an undetectable crime, and I'm sure you see the problem with an undetectable crime.

>Effects on the Lungs>Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50–70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;8 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.9 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.>Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, and a heightened risk of lung infections. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.10 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.From: http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/marijuana.htmlTL;DR: It has carcinogens, but hasn't been directly linked to cancer. However, it can still lead to lung illnesses. So, you're right in that it hasn't been proven to directly cause cancer, but it's hardly harmless to your body.

> Also, to those claiming this is censorship on the part of the mods, get a clue you bloody nurks. Banning photos of people smoking weed in cars isn't affecting your right to free speech or expression, please get a grip. I so tire of seeing this misinterpretation online. You are conflating the notion of freedom of speech, vs the notion of censorship. They are related, but distinctly separate issues.When a government censors you, that infringes your freedom of speech.When reddit censors you, that does not infringe your freedom of speech, it is perfectly legal, but it is still "censorship," which at its most basic level means "suppression of speech." If you stop someone from speaking, you are censoring them, whether you have the legal right to do so, or not. It just so happens that the admins and mods have the legal right to censor people on this private website.But it's still censorship.

What happens when the government taxes marijuana heavily, while cheap tax-free bud remains available on the street? Hint: they buy from the street.There's always going to be competition between the "legitimate market" and the "black market". A tax is another way to make the legitimate market less appealing.

>But I guess your civil rights don't matter to you. Civil rights? Give me a break. Smoking weed is no more a right than alcohol is. Alcohol is legal, but that doesn't mean its a right. Lots of things that are legal aren't rights, they're called privileges. Examples include all kinds of things, drinking, driving, cell phones, home ownership, pets. None of these are "rights." Voting is a right, freedom for peaceful assembly is a right. Freedom to practice religion, or not to as you see fit, is a right.

Well idk if you know this but beer is legal just about anywhere and can be bought almost anywhere and almost anytime, however weed is legal in very few places and can cost a hell of a lot more than beer.

>Now, as I see it, morality is something that can be explained in only 1 of 3 ways. It can either beThat's 2 ways: objective or subjective. You just have subjective listed a second time.> It implies that morality is based on evolutionary processes and is, essentially, objective within communities and subjective between communities. No. It's subjective. And once you define a criteria, you can objectively evaluate that subjective moral system.> If one believes that it is objective no matter what based on evolution, than it implies that your morality is not just best, but is best for naturally selective processes.That's only if you assert morals are based on biology. Which is an opinion.>Morality simply isn't subjective, or we wouldn't have laws as no one would agree on anything, and anything would go.Just like no one agrees on which ice cream is the best, or what movie you should watch. *Everyone* likes a different ice cream flavor, and there's absolutely no way to decide which ice cream flavor to get. Right.> Laws are based on an agreement that certain morals are beyond opinion.No they aren't. They are based on common opinion of what's best. These opinions are often times not best for the most people (alcohol outlawed, weed outlawed, religious freedom outlawed, etc).> I really don't feel an argument needs to be made for morality not being subjective as no high ranking atheist thinks so anyway.There's ranks? If anything, I think an argument needs to be made on how you objectively define what is 'good' or 'bad'. Because I'm not seeing it.> If you believe that morality is based on one's culture or time period, than you have no right whatsoever to say that another cultures morals are wrong.Well first we have proof morals are based on culture. And second, we can see cultures' moralities can contradict. On top of that, "having the right to say a moral is wrong" is an opinion. I can do what I damn well please. To say it's wrong is an opinion. That's the very nature of opinions themselves. You can disagree and vocalize your thoughts.>For instance, if you're American, clearly you would believe that Sharia law allowing one to reserve the right to cut of another person's hand if they steal from you is wrong. Within my subjective moral system, I would agree that it is wrong. Objectively, there is nothing morally wrong about that.> However, you believe morality intercommunally subjective so you have no ground to think that. You could, of course, accept that you have no right to think so but that's kind of conceding knowledge.I hold the subjective opinion that humans should be perfectly equal and should not harm each other. It then follows that they shouldn't cut off the hand of a person. I can certainly vocalize my opinion. That's the very nature of why people can vote for laws and the legal system in the first place. If the legal system (and morality) was objective, we'd simply have some scientists figure out what is objectively morally best and be done with it.>I feel this leaves us only with an objective morality that can only explained through an moral establisher.Once you define "a moral establisher" you have turned it into a subjective morality. Since you must refer to that subject's opinion on what is good/bad. And the fact that it's your opinion that they get to decide.

Straight up, good luck dude! Let us know how it turns outm pointers and stuff would be awesome. I know I got a few years to wait, but I'm prepping already, because my girlfriend had a bad experience with her step-dad being all "See this? It's weed! I can go to prison forever over this, so don't tell anyone!" when she was like six.

I'm glad this worked for you! My psychiatrist (I was seeing him for depression/anxiety) put me on ritalin, then adderall, because I was really tired. Yeah...he didn't even know that I am autistic, let alone that I have executive function problems, but I was hoping they would help anyway. Sadly, they didn't affect my EF. Ritalin gave me really bad headaches, so I couldn't keep taking it. Adderall kept me alert, but aggravated my anxiety too much and just made me frantic, which wasn't helpful. The only drug I've found that has even remotely affected my EF was marijuana, which I've only taken a few times (it's legal where I am). I found that I was able to just DO things without having to constantly talk myself through tasks. I thought that must be what having better executive function feels like. But, marijuana also made me unable to sleep, which is like the exact opposite of what it's supposed to do...my body tends to be really hypersensitive to drugs, I don't know. To u/IvorywTwig, I had a similar experience when I was trying to get Xanax, the only thing that really helped me with panic attacks after they're happening. (Now I'm on Prozac which is preventing them.) Your doctor will probably give you a really small amount to start. It's hard to get high off of something that treats a condition that you actually have. I never felt high off Xanax, Ritalin, or Adderall. I don't know about stimulants, but I do know that Xanax can be very habit-forming, so if that's the case with a drug you want to try, I would think it's important to express an understanding of that to your doctor, so that they know you're aware of any risks.

juvenile delinquent, kicked out of every high school attended. Went to alternative, private, boarding, military schools, christian school..got my GED and got into local college. Had a kid before graduating hs and got a girl pregnant and also (unrelated) put on felony probation for 5 years. Spent about a year total jail time, broken up into about 7-8 different occasions. Somehow got into State uni a couple years after messing around in comm college. Started getting an accounting degree and spent more time growing weed and working random jobs, never actually put anything into school. Loans basically up and I get to a point where the gig is up: my gpa drops too low and I'm kicked out of the business school. I took a couple semesters off and thought about things. Almost got a degree in public policy, which I'm glad I backed out of last minute.I thought long and hard one day and ultimately decided I would choose something worthwhile to me and just go all in and if I was going to go out it would be trying my best. I was done trying to pretend I had everything together without any struggle, and decided to give myself completely to something. I chose Computer science. Every semester since I've crammed up to 16 hours/semester and spending hours upon hours studying. 2 semesters left and I have all A's/B's in all math/computer science courses. I've learned so much over the last almost 2 years and I am so glad I made this decision. I'm no longer worried about my/daughter's future. I'm learning, I'm growing, I'm developing (albeit a little late in the game) from a delinquent into a very capable computer scientist. I don't even know what I want to do ultimately, I just know that I'm going to succeed because this is now my life and I love what I am becoming considering where I have come from. tl;dr - juvenile delinquent-turned-computer scientist grad(2 semesters left), total 180 degrees in life. one day just decided to do something worthwhile and try my hardest at it and it has been working out.

I do know what a migraine is. Lots of people use medical marijuana for migraines. It doesn't cure your migraine, but many patients say that it relieves several of their migraine symptoms. Not sure why I'm getting downvoted though. It was a legitimate question :/

Not just the highest per capita prison population, but also the *highest prison population period*. 25% of the world's prisoners are in US prisons, 25% of those US inmates are in for *non-violent drug crimes*. About half of the non-violent drug offenders are in for marijuana related crimes.

I agree pot shouldn't be as criminalized as it is, but let's face it, some people are just not really able to handle being high from weed. And I know people who are constantly high on weed. It stops being fun after a while. They eat so much, and they smell so bad.

The companies that drug test will continue to do so. Medical marijuana is legal in CO, but you can still be refused a job or fired if you fail a drug test, even if you have the medical card. As long as it isn't a protected status, a company can hire or fire you on whatever basis they like.

Because of the 10th amendment, which states :>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.So basically, the federal government isn't supposed to have the final say over everything. There are some things that the states can make laws on that override federal laws, such as the use of marijuana for non-medical use.However, if the Supreme Court gets involved, their ruling is final. If the Constitution grants the federal government authority to legislate in an area, it can (but need not) override state law in the same area.**TL;DR: The Federal Government can only exercise the power that the Constitution gives it, if they don't have the power, it is vested in the states.**

Wow, Louisiana. According to this, Louisiana & Texas are thriving in the private prison industry, with nearly 1,000 per 100,000 in jail. I wonder how many of these incarcerations are for marijuana possession?

>The study reverses the theory that keeping marijuana illegal contributes to the high number of arrests among African-Americans.If arrests of black people dropped - and they dropped drastically - then no, it doesn't "reverse the theory." Because if arrests dropped, then prohibition obviously did contribute to the high number of arrests among black people.

It demonstrates that "it will be as hard to get as alcohol" is a shitty argument because alcohol is clearly not hard to get if kids access it way more often than weed.> But, there is no question it would it harder for kids to get, legally.Well, yeah, but the same is true of keeping it illegal. Making it illegal makes it harder for everyone to get legally but this has nothing to do with whether or not it actually makes it hard to get.

I don't understand this. Why are there aliens, first of all. And I think if we got attacked we would put up some fight with our military before they were able to poison our toys and shit. Um. and wtf does this have to do with weed? Fucking aliens raping our land and the supreme court wtf is this? Im so very high and I just don't get it?!

Trees are the gift from God.He said in Genesis that he gave us ALL seed baring plants for us to consume, use, and enjoy!I strongly believe in God. And I know our lord intended us to use this wonderful plant to our liking.The bible warns of mankind banning a creation of nature, when it is not in their jurisdiction to do so.God foresaw the prohibition of cannabis.I'm not saying go to church and believe whatever that preacher tells you. On the contrary, I think a lot of churches are corrupt and evil. Form a relationship with God on your own terms. Pray. Give thanks. Ask and you shall receive!Be a good person, and you shall be rewarded by our Lord.Followers of God master race! [6]

Isn't that kind of a light sentence for so much weed in the US? I had a friend caught with 40 pounds here in Canada about 6 or 7 years ago when laws were much less strict and he only got 2 years. Served 6 months.

P!nk is a very well established musician, she has a lot of very serious, not so "poppy" songs. Like the Beatles, just because she got famous off silly pop songs doesn't mean she isn't to be taken seriously. 2Chainz is riding on the absolutely ridiculous influx of terrible rap songs about the same old thing, sex, money, weed. Instead of making legitimately good music, he's just cashing in on the #YOLO train and he will soon fizzle out.I'd like to say that 2000-2010 had it's own unique sound but I'm hard pressed to put a name on it. I suppose you could say that it was the decade of pop, since pop songs have completely dominated the music scene...but I'd say it was a ton of stuff mixed together. It's a melting pot of music. I'm not saying this decade didn't have it's fair share of "Why the fuck is this song popular?" moments, but so did every other decade.

In no particular order:Continued Iraq/Afghanistan occupation. Libyan air strikes. Goldman/Sachs running the FED, Treasury and monetary policy. Health care legislation containing no reform. Lack of transparency. GITMO still being open. Endorsing the Patriot Act. Continuing the drug war. Maintaining the status quo on marijuana.Do I need more?

[source](http://www.dsmattorneys.com/criminalprocess.html)>The general rule is that warrants are required for searches. However, search warrants are not required for the following:>Search Incident to Arrest. Police officers are permitted to search your body and/or clothing for weapons or other contraband when making a valid arrest.>Automobile Searches. If you are arrested in a vehicle, the police may search the inside of the vehicle. To perform a complete search of the vehicle (such as in locked glove compartments, for example), probable cause is necessary.For police to search a car without a search warrant, they have to place you under arrest first. This usually only applies for people who have been caught drunk driving. A police officer smells marijuana. He cannot make an arrest because he smells the weed. If he cannot arrest you, he cannot search your car without a warrant. edit: formatting

Neither are state marriage laws. Supreme court *just* ruled on it. Part of DOMA out, state by state still in. No constitutional violation. Still not seeing how marijuana is a constitutional issue... you keep referencing federal law, which they are constitutionally free to change. Not a constitutional issue *at all.* unless you're arguing that *every* federal law is a constitutional issue because... what... the constitution gives them the right to make laws? Like DOMA?

Surprisingly, law enforcement might have a reason to vote Yes on Prop 19 that they have not thought about.Although local law enforcement cannot "enforce" federal laws, they can "assist" federal law enforcement (DEA) enforce federal laws. So, DEA doesn't currently have the man power to enforce federal minor marijuana laws. But with the passage of Prop 19, they might have the sudden desire to. But in order to do so they would need the help of local law enforcement. And why would local law enforcement want to help?Federal law enforcement (DEA) can share any forfeiture gains with the local law enforcement agency. And since federal forfeiture rules are so much more lenient and broad, law enforcement can capitalize much more by going through federal forfeiture than state forfeiture rules. And guess where those forfeited assets go? Law enforcement's general fund (to pay for retirement parties, overtime, etc.).Scary thought right?

You don't understand. The weed that is grown indoors can't be grown naturally in the outdoors. It's cloned, it has no seeds. It will always be in demand. If anything, growhouses would be too small to be competitive, and growers would have to invest in large warehouses. The reason would be because so many people would start growing, the market would be flooded, and growers will start lowering the price as much as they can till they are making minimum profit and covering their overhead. People growing right now illegally out of houses would be quickly put out of business by people with enough start up money to go straight into a large warehouse. A warehouse would be able to produce much more than a house. I really don't know how the monthly costs of the house might compare to the monthly overhead of a warehouse, but they are probably not too far apart. But then the warehouse probably produces at least twice the output of the house, meaning they can reduce the cost they sell at until no one is willing to buy from the guy growing out of his house, because if the home grower tries to match the warehouse price, he makes no profit, and can't pay his own bills.

Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands :)(It's also only quasi legal there, and tourists aren't legally*** allowed to buy it anymore)Pretty soon it's going to be no contest. America will have the largest weed market and the best weed in the world. (It's really not even a contest now)

Definitely interesting and a good move but I wouldn't expect an instantaneous change with banks. They will need to change their own internal policies and develop standards for doing business with legal marijuana businesses. Also, they will need to decide if it is worth the risk of doing business with them.I work in KYC compliance for the private banking business line of a large financial institution and there are certain types of business (ex. casinos) that they are prohibited from opening accounts for because the risk that comes with them is just not worth the money they'd bring.

Ha, sorry that when I research a subject I don't source everything in case I run into someone on the internet who doesn't want to do their own research but yet still wants to yell at me. But here's a couple.....>Clinical studies have given contradictory reports on the effect of smoking marijuana on the plasma levels of testosterone in males. A **reanalysis of existing data established that testosterone levels are depressed both after smoking one marijuana cigarette** and after intravenous infusion of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, a pharmacologically active component of marijuana. Simulation of the marijuana interaction, under the assumption that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol **inhibits testosterone production or secretion, suggests a minimum of 24 hours are required for testosterone to return to pre-smoking levels**. A series of clinical studies are specified to clarify the nature of the interaction. - *"Effects of marijuana on testosterone in male subjects.Barnett G, Chiang CW, Licko V."*...>THC had a **significant effect on spermatogenesis and decreased the number of all germinal cells**. - "Interactive effects of chronic phencyclidine and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol on spermatogenesis in mice"...>During chronic exposure to THC the pharmacokinetic molecular mechanisms which limit the storage of THC in the brain and testis are not sufficient to prevent a persistent deregulation of membrane signalling and the induction of functional and morphological changes which reflect a **premature apoptosis of spermatogenic cells**. Long term, longitudinal epidemiological studies have reported **decreased spermatogenesis in healthy, fertile adult males**. - *"Pharmacokinetics of THC in brain and testis, male gametotoxicity and premature apoptosis of spermatozoa"*...>Testosterone 6β- and 16a-hydroxylase activities together with androstenedione formation from **testosterone in rat liver microsomes were also significantly inhibited by the crude marijuana extracts and the cannabinoids**. Crude marijuana extracts (1 and 10 μg/ml) of THCA strain stimulated the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, although the purified cannabinoids (THC, CBD and CBN) did not show significant effects, such as the extract at the concentration of 0.01-1000 nM. These results indicate that there are **some metabolic interactions between cannabinoid and steroid metabolism and that the constituents showing estrogen-like activity exist in marijuana**. - *"Marijuana extracts possess the effects like the endocrine disrupting chemicals"*...># It **inhibits the release of a substance in the brain called GnRH**. GnRH normally triggers the pituitary gland to **release two hormones called FSH and LH which cause the testis to make testosterone and to improve sperm production and function**. So **marijuana use can directly lower testosterone levels and impair testicular sperm production**.In a test tube, the active substance in **marijuana THC was shown to impair sperm function and to impair a sperm's ability to fertilize an egg**. - *"http://fertilityspot.com/can-marijuana-use-affect-fertility.html"*...>Recreational Drugs: Marijuana (cannabinoid) often causes a **decrease in average sperm count, motility, and normal morphology, and can affect the HPG axis,(causing decreased plasma testosterone)** as well as have a direct negative effect on the Leydig Cells. - *"Reproductive Biology Associates"*Here are some sources, if you'd like to continue a discussion on marijuana and its affect on your hormones I'm all for it. Until then it's called science shithead, learn to use it. There are sources which claim marijuana does not affect testosterone levels, but there is enough information to suggest that it does, and at the least, disrupts the normal functioning of sexual hormones.

You have it backwards. It absolutely is NOT physically addictive, it MAY be psychologically addictive to SOME people. To the point of it being a "gateway drug" - no, it's not. The "gateway" is DARE and programs like it telling us from a young age that all drugs will either make you go insane, make you so addicted you'll turn to crime to support your habit, straight up kill you, or any combination of those things. Then when those kids smoke weed for the first time and realize everything they've been told about THAT drug is bullshit, they assume EVERYTHING they've been told about ALL drugs is bullshit, leading to having an extreme openness to try other drugs.TL;DR: DARE is the real gateway drug and we should stop lying to our kids and trying to scare them away from drugs, and should START being honest instead.

US Constitution, Article 6, paragraph 2: >This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. Constitutionally speaking, all Federal laws trump any state law on the matter. State laws may however be more restrictive, or compulsive, whatever the nature of the statute. The tenth amendment 'merely' states that were Federal law does not speak, the matter falls to the states, and failing that, the right is reserved to the people. Since in this case Federal law has a statute prohibiting marijuana, the text of the tenth amendment isn't relevant. A constitutional challenge to marijuana prohibition would have to be based on a different facet of the constitution, and be focused on a supposed lack of authority of the federal government to pass legislation on the matter. I believe that the supreme court has ruled that it does have such authority though, or precedent to that effect, so a constitutional challenge may be for naught. May be better to focus on removing the law.

Smaller and lower are both relative terms. There is a lot of spending to cut while still having money to spend on social programs.There is also money to be saved or gained by being more socially liberal, i.e taxing marijuana, not needing to spend so much money on the court systems, etc.

> You don't need a study to show that something that is suddenly widely available will be used more.For marijuana you absolutely do. It's so widely available today that increases in use with legalization are not expected in younger demographics. Increases in older demographics may occur. This really isn't as simple as it may seem to be at first glance.

SexDrugs: The tide is turning. These "tired" arguments are working.This year, in recent polls, a *majority* of Americans finally support marijuana legalization. It's sort of a major turning point for marijuana:http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/record-high-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspxWe finally have majority support in America. Now its time to turn that majority support into supermajority support, which even Congress will eventually have to listen to.

It wasn't just blacks, it was the antiwar left as well. Basically the two big demographics opposed to Nixon. But Ehrlichman never said that mass incarceration was the goal. The goal was to marginalize those groups. > "You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."

I think they realize that a lot of people would just grow it themselves. Alcohol prohibition repeal gave a lot of business back to large producers and took away from smaller "bootleggers", but cannabis is easier to grow. It's even easier than tobacco. Plenty of people would buy it at the store but plenty would grow it at home. If legal to do outdoors, 3 medium MJ plants next to tomatoes and peppers in a garden would supply me for most of the year for free.

Ergo while he is not physically the same person as Obama, his actions in the context of his role as Attorney General are officially Obama's actions.

Exactly. Some may argue It's better for the kid but I remember growing up with a few kids who's parents smoked and most of them turned out a lot better than the kids who had a parent or two in prison. Throwing a kid's parent in jail over smoking pot leads to a child's freedom with no guidance, It's sad how screwed up our justice system works..

No he doesn't. Plus, do you really think that with all the support of legal weed that it's going to do anything other than become more and more accepted? Legal weed ain't going to be shut down, that cats' already out of the bag. If the citizens want it to remain legal it will remain legal.

I absolutely have to wait several days in between gabapentin doses to get the same floaty, euphoric effects. If I take it two days in a row, nada. Wait like 4 days and take a slightly (only slightly) higher dose, and try that.Benzos don't seem to change my experience of gabapentin much (unless I am legitimately trying to sleep, then it will just help me sleep better), but combining gabapentin with good weed, or once gabapentin with like 12mg of 5-MeO-MiPT, is usually awesome for me.

Currently some medical programs are basically a cover for legalized cannabis. That problem should (hopefully) go away soon with full recreational legalization. Who gets to choose what are "legitimate medical uses"? There are many people with many different illnesses, diseases, conditions, and disorders that respond amazingly well with cannabis treatment.Cannabis is not like other medications. There is nothing else like cannabis around. Yeah lots of people use it to get high, and lots of people use it to help treat conditions they have, and many use it as both. If a condition, such as let's say depression or anxiety, responds well to cannabis usage, how is that not a proper medicinal use? The part where they are "just getting high" is the part that legitimately helps them.

I don't know Colorado state laws, but no one was going to jail on a felony possession charge for under an ounce of marijuana. In my state possession of up to 50 grams (almost 2 ounces) is still a disorderly persons offense. To get a felony intent charge, you not only have to have over one ounce, but there has to be baggies for distribution, scales, large amounts of cash, etc. If someone went to jail over marijuana, it was most likely for this and they are still criminals under Colorado law if there's any similarities between these states.

But the church is made up of the people, so are they worshiping themselves, are they worshiping the church leaders, or are they worshiping the physical building? How do you know God is not real? They believe they are worshiping an entity called God, so how can their worship be misdirected if they are incorrect? If their aim was really off, would they be worshiping a tomato called Stan? Is Stan for legalization of marijuana, and how does he taste when made into pasta sauce?

I have driven all across the country from a [0] to a [10] and have *never ever* felt once that cannabis has *ever* impaired my driving abilities. I have lived in several major cities (in the U.S. and abroad), spent countless hours road tripping, driven in horrible weather and on some of the sketchiest roads that most people would not drive on sober.I started smoking a little over a decade ago and I have always felt that cannabis does not impair my abilities to operate a motor vehicle.Alcohol impairs your abilities to drive.Bad vision impairs your abilities to drive.Negative emotions impair your abilities to drive.Defective vehicles impair your abilities to drive.Speeding impairs your ability to drive safely.People who do not obey traffic laws, elderly people, teenagers, pharmaceuticals, drowsy drivers, animals all put you at risk on the road.Being under the influence of cannabis **does not.**

Heres what O'Rourke said in an interview... "What I have promised the people of El Paso is I am not running to legalize marijuana. I am not running to make the drug war front-and-center in El Paso's agenda, but when national legislation starts to affect El Paso and the border, I'm going to make sure that our views are represented, and at a minimum, I think most of us in El Paso can agree that what we are doing today is a failure,".

The Liberal party is left of center on the political spectrum; the Conservative party is right-wing. The Liberals are generally left-wing on social issues, like legalizing marijuana, supporting gay marriage, supporting abortion rights, etc. They are also more centre/left on economics and budget. Not as socialist as the NDP but far more so than the Conservatives. The Conservatives on the other hand are right-wing, fiscally conservative, in favour of lower taxes, support strong military, and fewer restrictions on environmental protection. And they're [unofficially] socially conservative on issues like abortion, gay marriage, etc.

I see this claim made about the supremacy clause again and again and it's always false. The supremacy clause does not give the federal government power. The rest of the constitution does. Large parts of the constitution list what the federal government CAN make and enforce laws about, and it says that is the power not *explicitly listed* is not given. The bill of rights explicitly list things the federal government *can't* make laws about. The supremacy clause says that *in those areas where the constitution says the federal government can make law* that those laws shall be the supreme law of the land. It in no way invalidates the *constitutional limitation of powers.* The issue here is not *is a federal law about pot the supreme law of the land* but rather *does the federal government have any right to make laws about pot in the first place.*

Never heard of William Randolph Hearst, have you? He basically owned the newspaper industry. He also owned forests, which he used for paper for his newspapers. He was one of the main reasons cannabis was made illegal (he started the smear campaign against it). DuPont also was against it because of his company's work with plastics, which can also be made from hemp.Edit:Here, go educate yourself: http://www.jackherer.com/thebook/

You said you agree that it's fair for the health risk to be used as a reason against cannabis legalization. And then you said the same health risk should also be applied to alcohol and tobacco. Then you said that you don't believe alcohol and tobacco aren't being scrutinized in the same way. What's I'm saying is that they aren't being scrutinized in the same way because there isn't a debate about whether they should be legal or not -- they already are legal. Why would alcohol and tobacco both be scrutinized as though they were being considered for legalization? The fact is they won't be because they are already legal. Despite all the damage both alcohol and tobacco can cause, the public has already accepted them as being suitable for legally obtainable substances. The same can't be said about cannabis. Legal and illegal drugs aren't going to be treated the same and why should they? No one needs to make the case for legalizing either of them. The only scrutiny applied to alcohol and tobacco is in order to minimize the potential risk. Cannabis is not only be scrutiniZed for potential risk if it were legalized, it's also being scrutinized over whether the health risk allow for it to be legalized. You said alcohol and tobacco should be treated the same way as cannabis. Why? As I see it they are in two distinct groups.

Sooooo last night me my friend cam and these two girls are sittin in this girls suburban at an elementary school. We are in Seattle and we are vaping with my new polite wispr. We are all high as hell an I turn off the vape and put it in the pocket on the back of the drivers seat. About two minutes later. Lights. There are three pairs of lights that flip on all at once and we are shook. The girl opens her door andvthe cop says stay in the car! About 5 of them come up and open our doors and they ask us if we are taking advantage of the new pot laws.lol. We say no and they tell us about a string of burgurlarys and tell us the neighbors were a bit freaked out. Needless to say we were relieved but still had our hearts beating quite fast. We were all keyed as hell and just drove away.

Not just an excuse, it helps pay for their toys. In many areas of the US, drug war forfeitures comprise a significant portion of the law enforcement budget. In other areas federal grant funding of local law enforcement is tied to cooperation with unpopular DEA enforcement (like helicopter searching of marijuana plants). This is one of the hurdles of ending the drug war, it literally pays for the police to keep fighting the drug war.

It is up to the judge to eliminate that kind of intimidation. If he fails to do that who knows what else he is doing to throw the trial -- probably everybody but the jury. If I was on a jury, and I saw a courtroom full of uniforms, my first thoughts would be this guy is guilty as sin if this is what he needs to do to get a not guilty verdict.The judge gets to decide what evidence the jury will hear, and what it will not hear. The judge even gets to decide what kind of a defense the defendant is allowed to bring up. In some cases, judges have been known to deny the defendant any real defense. The defense tactic in such cases is usually not say anything, and let the jury figure out that something is hinky. This happens a lot with medical pot cases, but is certainly not limited to them.

It sounded like really dry wood does when you toss it on a campfire. I also compared it to pop rocks. Really weird. Oh well. I got blazed as shit so the sound of the weed doesn't really matter much. I also don't think I ever expected to write the previous sentence.

Attorney General Eric Holder said at a press conference Wednesday that the Justice Department will no longer raid medical marijuana clubs that are established legally under state law. His declaration is a fulfillment of a campaign promise by President Barack Obama, and marks a major shift from the previous administration.After the inauguration, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) continued to carry out such raids, despite Obama’s promise. Holder was asked if those raids represented American policy going forward.“No,” he said. “What the president said during the campaign, you’ll be surprised to know, will be consistent with what we’ll be doing in law enforcement. He was my boss during the campaign. He is formally and technically and by law my boss now. What he said during the campaign is now American policy.”http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/26/holder-vows-to-end-raids_n_170119.html

Well, alcohol and cigarettes are both legal, and kids, even very young kids experiment with them at fairly young ages. Kids also experiment with their parent's prescription drugs too. The problem with legalizing anything is that once it's in the house, kids can and do get a hold of it. This can be a problem because pot isn't good for developing brains. It isn't good for teens, and probably worse for 10 years old.

Why is it interesting? doesn't most of the north east have medical/decriminalization laws? I would think the west coast and the north east are the two places most would expect to legalize weed.

Actually, I can relate. My imbalances have gotten a little better since then, and I have a hard time bringing myself to eat even though I'm hungry. I typically regulate my appetite with cannabis, which also helps with my anxiety and depression. Contradictory to what most believe, I eat better (healthier) in portion and what I eat than I do without. It sucks on both sides of the spectrum.

Yeah maybe dont break the law and you wont have to worry about it being enforced or actually vote for sanders since hes pro weed and thats all that matters to the addicts on this site.

I lost all of my high school friends about 2 months before graduation. The entire group I hung out with collectively decided to not want me around any more and just cut me off. I met them at my local high school which I got expelled from because I gave away a gram of weed to a friend who got caught and told on me. We still remained friends when I moved away to a military boarding school, but we still hung out on the weekends until they ditched me. It depressed me so much that I couldn't maintain friendships at military school. Ironically, I got expelled from THAT school for smoking cigarettes (my 3rd offense), and finished off my last 2 months of school back at a local alternative school, where I met no one. To this day, I have no lasting friendships from anyone I went to any high school with. Not even a week ago I got slightly "depressed" over something (on vacation of all places) and was reminded of the whole high school thing again. Happens every time, and it never fails to make things worse.

There needs to be a case where an employee of a company works at say home or just an inside office job. where the company has no reason to insure you etc. to be fired for recreational use on their own time. That employee will need to sue for wrongful termination and argue that cannabis use on their free time is just the same as drinking at home and has no baring on performance at the work place. Better tests need to be created to determine if the employee was high on the job or just smoked a joint on their free time.Edit: not a good idea to go to work baked off your ass.

While that's true, finding laced weed DOES happen and legalization would pretty much rid of this problem. Some people don't know any better and get weed from anyone they possibly can, not always knowing who sold them the weed.

I've never tried it, never really felt the need. I hang around a lot of people who smoke on a regular basis, though, and it doesn't bother me at all. I'm all for legalization and all that. I just don't really think weed would enhance my life at all so I've stayed away from it so far.

I don't know if it is because of the dealer, but I do agree that our laws make it a gateway drug. Kids are told how much illegal drugs will screw up your life. Then they try weed, and it doesn't screw up their life. If they were told weed was so evil when it was fine, why would they believe meth is as bad as they were told?

I attended the last five meetings of the semester and have been pretty active. We meet once a week to discuss events, both fundraising and club related. Next semester is dedicated to Extravaganja and fundraising for it, and some of those fundraisers are already in the works including a Fundrager, Battle of the Bands, and something else I can't remember. Also, we're working on putting together educational events.Last weekend, some of us (including myself) attended the MassCann meeting (which was a disaster, by the way) and discussed legalization initiatives for '12. We also do events for club members (I went bowling with them a few weeks ago.)

If your college offers a certain number of penalty-free drops, don't be afraid to use them.I was put in a 9am chem class first semester freshman year, and ended up dropping it. I stayed up too late, didn't study, and fell asleep in class. Minus the falling asleep in class, this is how I got through high school. I thought that since I had taken chem in HS, that I would be fine. WRONG. I got lost in the material and would have failed, so I dropped the class and my GPA didn't suffer. I retook the equivalent class a later semester and got an A, once I was used to college.Also, don't smoke too much weed. That's why I stayed up too late, didn't study, and fell asleep in class.

To answer your question, yes. The psychological withdrawals from the rush of dopamine that weed provided was an emotional damper. Now that your brain is aware that you are not chemically providing it with something that was pleasurable, it's also going haywire because it doesn't know how to handle the stress of every day life. That stress is causing you to have abnormal levels of anxiety. The surest way to decrease your anxiety and regulate to a healthy level of stress is to do many of the things that are recommended on this sub: exercise, eat healthier, find a new hobby, and meditate. Creating these healthy habits will improve your overall quality of life and mental coping mechanism. To fall asleep easier, drink some chamomile tea and take some melatonin. You will find that decreasing your anxiety and stress levels will give you more peace of mind. Stay strong my friends - remember, it's never too late to enjoy so much of what this life has to offer! Peace :)

Mayor McGinn, on October 7, [the city council decided that medical marijuana dispensaries within city limits would, essentially, be forced to close down](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/10/07/city-council-votes-to-effectively-ban-medical-marijuana-dispensaries), as they would be required to have a state-issued license to operate. Only [21 licenses have been issued for the city of Seattle](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021756206_potrulesxml.html); licenses intended only for recreational dispensaries. Do you believe that this is fair to patients and existing dispensaries?

While I wholeheartedly share the sentiment, the title is misleading. It should be:Outrage- Black guy gets life for armed robbery and violating parole with pot, white guy gets probation for murder and violating parole with cocaine.Or probably something shorter. Bottom line, you shouldn't compare the parole violation of one person to the initial crime of the other.

Im for it. In my experience the war on drugs has caused more problems than it solves. I know a lot of good people who have the potential to contribute a lot to society, but have been held back professionally (not to mention socially and culturally) due to felonies due to marijuana offenses.
82339254
I have a very open mind about drugs. I believe strongly in the idea of reducing drug addiction, violence, and abuse through harm reduction and education rather than the "war on drugs" that has been used for decades in the United States. I'm also pro legalization for marijuana, as well as schedule reduction for a handful of drugs (LSD and MDMA specifically) as I believe they have been wrongly demonized via media and government in the past.

You'd likely sing a different tune if you'd lived in New Mexico during this man's tenure. His policies on decriminalizing marijuana made sense, but the vast majority of his governing was very unilateral and reminds me of the sort of policies Bush has been following in his pursuit of the "unitary executive". Johnson did some good things while governor, but I think the pair as running mates would only serve to hurt Paul's cause.Still, Johnson is a free-thinker and politician who does what he truly believes. It would be *fun* to watch, but there would be no inauguration.

I wasn't trying to debate that. My original comment was just an analysis of the facts presented in that the first article you linked. You quoted OP:>to say underground sales will flourish is clearly lacking any basis of facts.but the article you linked didn't prove that *underground sales* flourished, it said legally sold marijuana was being diverted out of state. I'm not trying to suggest I have a factual basis for saying the tax rate wouldn't affect black market sales, I just read the first article you posted and commented on it specifically.I can absolutely believe that a high tax rate allowed the black market to flourish, it seems very intuitive. I was just pointing out that the first article wasn't actually about that.

Marijuana stocks. With the recent legalization in Washington and Colorado the stocks revolving around marijuana have been going nuts (extremely volatile, + or - 10% in a trading day). Most of them are penny stocks (MJNA, PHOT). I still havent done any trading in the MJ arena.

No, they are not fully [sovereign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty). Sovereignty requires that the entity be able independently to create the supreme law of the land. While some powers are reserved for the states, others are clearly given to the federal government. This is express in the [supremacy clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) of the federal constitution, and results in federal law [preempting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption) state law in case of a conflict. You're right that they *were* sovereign prior to the ratification of the Constitution, but they ceded sufficiently much of that sovereignty to the federal government that they can no longer be called properly sovereign. They may even be a textual argument that the [10th Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) should have been understood as more powerful than it is currently treated, but its application is limited to barring the feds from commandeering the officers of the state to enforce federal law, which is why the Denver police will not be enforcing federal marijuana laws.

Out of scope. I objected to your foundational point: gun bans will lead to "a mass murderer without access to guns." This is a fiction, just like the fiction of alcohol and marijuana prohibition.Also, we have "reasonable restrictions on guns." Do you know anything about gun laws in the US? Do you know about background checks and limits on machine guns?

An interesting idea for sure. I think the country is taking a step in the right direction with how many states are looking to legalize weed so maybe things will get better in the coming decades.

Not true that he's not making a difference. He and supporters pushed the Democratic Party to make lots of changes to its platform, including supporting marijuana legalization and universal health care. And he got Clinton to support pretty much his tuition-fe college plan. And he paved the way for other people to run serious progressive campaigns for national office. It was always very, very very unlikely that he would win, given the sad reality of vote fraud and manipulation in this country.

Actually it seems quite the opposite in my experience. I quite often see references to legalization and cannabis as some of the most upvoted comments; not always, but quite often. Conversely I hardly see many cannabis-referencing posts with a negative karma score.

For one, I think the penalties regarding minors are too stiff. 7 years for passing a joint to a 17 year old, even unknowingly? If an 18 year old gives marijuana to 14 year old, that's another 7 years. Really? I'm not advocating minors smoking weed, but hell, there are no such penalties currently.

The gold bud and the red bud I was getting in the mid 1970s was *amazing*. I'm sure the cultivated strains are just as good today, but I live in a state where I can't get that. And I'm old, with no good connections, so I've only been able to get sleepy dirtweed. So from my perspective the potency has gone down. I wish I lived in a state where I could buy good weed legally.

I never actually said that. All I was implying is my stance is neutral regarding the controversial over weed. Don't make unnecessarily assumptions like that, it just makes you sound like a tool. And may I add it's consider a logical fallacy to assume that I'm satisfied with laws never being changed and "fine how they are?" solely off of my statement. Please use your head.

Me personally I didn't really give a fuck in highschool. I mean I tried grade 9 and 10. In my high school if you missed class there was an automated system that called your home phone and my parents would give me shit if I did it. Once I was 18 I was allowed to change the home number, I ended up skipping quite a bit of class because I tried to take a lot of classes at the same time to get ready for university and it was overwhelming. Also would smoke a bit of weed at the time...Once I finished grade 12 I returned for a victory lap because I didn't know what I wanted to do for my future.In the end I went to do a 3 year program at college for marine engineering. Currently in my third year, on coop and I managed to get a crew position as engineer position making about $350 CAD a day. Once I actually graduate I write my 4th class engineer ticket and end up making around $400 a day to start.To sum it up I think I didn't really give a fuck in high school once I figured out about skipping classes. Also doing classes I had absolute no interest in.College turned out to be a great experience and I was legitimately interested in every course as it all related to marine engineering. Hope this kind of helped and I apologize for lack of grammar. Tired and typing on phone haha

Why would the same need to apply? I would argue that the legal age for marijuana use should be higher than for the other two, simply because the risk of marijuana use upon legalisation and higher average use would be much worse.

I vote for: Not going to war whenever we can, possible legalization of marijuana, getting rid of profit prisons, etc etc. Sure taxes will go up. But if its for the greater good then I have no problem. I'd rather pay a little more and have great things for all than pay less taxes and just get 80 dollars extra a paycheck.

It depends on the time of day. Probably keep working, most likely. Just because it's legal doesn't mean companies would be required to allow marijuana smokers to work there. A company could still choose to drug test their employees, IIRC.

"The maximum impairment after the highest THC dose (300 ug/kg) was within a range of effects produced by many commonly used medicinal drugs and less than that associated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08" - *U.S. D.O.T. study* "There is little if any evidence to indicate that drivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely to cause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in single inhaled doses up to 250 µg/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance" - *University of Sydney and National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales* "THC's effects on road-tracking after doses up to 300 µg/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08; and, were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs (Robbe, 1994; Robbe and O'Hanlon, 1995; O'Hanlon et al., 1995)" - *University of Limburg, Netherlands* "There was no evidence of any increase in the likelihood of being culpable for [automobile] crash[es] amongst those injured drivers in whom cannabinoids were detected" - *University of Adelaide, South Australia* "marijuana taken alone in moderate amounts does not significantly increase a driver's risk of causing an accident" - *University of Toronto, Canada* "In two studies with reasonable numbers of individuals who had only used cannabis, there was no clear evidence of increased culpability in these drivers." - *The Lancet* "No increased risk for road trauma was found for drivers exposed to cannabis" - *Dutch National Road Safety Research Institute* "Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving" - *Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs* "In terms of road safety, it cannot be concluded that driving under the influence [of marijuana] is not a hazard [...] In comparison with alcohol however, the severe effects of alcohol on driving are likely to make this more of a hazard" - *Road Safety Division Report, UK*

No - my point is that limited law enforcement resources require there to be some degree of prioritization of resources. In states where there are no local or state resources available to fight marijuana as a whole, it makes more sense to prioritize those who are breaking both local, state, AND federal marijuana laws.For example, you'll see the DEA and local/state police raiding dispensaries in Colorado/California/etc that are in violation of the local/state laws, but you won't really see them going after those in compliance with the state laws.In this way, our limited federal law enforcement resources aren't wasted fighting a losing battle. It's not that they can't enforce the laws, just that to do so would require reducing resources for other law enforcement priorities.
39085461
Honestly it would be really difficult to give those numbers. If a lot of things changed (reduced defense budget, consolidated all health services under a universal healthcare plan, marijuana legalization and taxation, etc), the new tax rate could be lower, if nothing changed, the new tax rate would have to be much higher to account for all our currently wasteful spending.

People would buy it legally because buying it legally would be cheaper and easier to get. Do you really think a relatively easy to grow flower would still cost $20 a gram? Growing legally allows you to grow the plant on much larger areas of land allowing legal operations far out-produce the illegal ones. Also, there is a huge connoisseur culture among smokers, so there would be a niche for large scale producers of high quality cannabis.

Well the US has a lot of political clout in the UN and throughout the world. When they threw their weight behind anti-drug treaties like the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, most countries signed on. The US has continued to exert their influence to make countries continue to comply with these agreements. As to why the US government wants marijuana to be universally illegal, that's a whole 'nother discussion.The Netherlands have developed their policy caught between two great forces: the will of the US as outlined in treaty agreements, and the desire not to continue an injustice against their own citizens. What they have is a rather imperfect system of decriminalization and turning a blind eye.

There are international treaties Iran has signed to. Further, the US can partner with other Western countries to put economic pressure on Iran or even use existing talks to snuff out any possibility of domestic legalization. The US does not have complete control over Iran, but the international community has a big influence and Iran has already signed itself to treaties that it probably won't go through the trouble of withdrawing and rejoining the UN for. It's not true that it could "pull this off with little to no problems." The UN issue is a big one and Iran, as a founding member, isn't going to withdraw. Even the US must consider existing international conventions when federally legalizing marijuana and any drug beyond that would be far more difficult, particularly one like opium that is currently a "bad" drug fueling the international trade.

I think he simply meant in terms of its legal designation. Cocaine is schedule II whereas marijuana is schedule I. Schedule I drugs have "no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States", whereas schedule II drugs "have currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, or currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions" (from Wikipedia). Seems crazy to me too, but I'm not from the US.

Because frequently the bike lane is just a painted shoulder filled with glass and pot holes. OR they put you right in the door zone.Depending on your jurisdiction, some have laws that say something to the effect of cyclists must use the bike lane unless it is unsafe to do so. Weaving because of obstacles or riding in the door zone is unsafe, so some cyclists just choose to assume that bike lanes are disaster zones.

It would be a bad idea to think that pot legalization and serious tourism were mutually exclusive. Since you're addicted to bad ideas, it would make sense for you to have the idea that they are mutually exclusive. But by saying that you didn't realize that they are mutually exclusive, you contradict your name.

I'd like to go into a little more detail.An officer who pulls you over or walks up to your car needs Probable Cause to search your car. This can be obtained in many different ways like having illegal paraphernalia in plain sight (the officer can reach into your car and grab it allowing him to look for more), looking as though you are trying to hide something gives an officer probable cause, or doing something illegal in the first place gives an officer probable cause too. If you are arrested your vehicle can be searched without your consent because Probable Cause was proven and is no longer needed to search .If an officer asks you for consent to search your vehicle you do not have to give the officer consent to search your vehicle. If an officer has Probable Cause to search your vehicle than you would probably be detained in case something illegal is found in your vehicle. The only time warrants are really needed in the search of a car is if you are brought in on the suspicion of committing a crime and don't give consent to the search and seizure of your property, of course this happens in a manner different from traffic stops...Here's some advice for the people, if you have anything illegal in your car keep it out of sight, if you keep documents in your glove box guess where not to put all of your weed? Don't act suspicious and give the officer Probable Cause to search your car, keep your hands on the steering wheel, politely answer the officer's questions, if asked exit the vehicle, etc,etc.
