Ron Paul is co-sponsor on both bills. From the link that I posted earlier: "Representative Ron Paul (R-TX) joined Frank as a cosponsor of the federal penalties bill. The cosponsors of the medical marijuana bill are Rep. Paul, along with Reps. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), and Sam Farr (D-CA)."

It's an infraction for less than like 1/4 or something now. We now have medical marijuana licenses, but it's only a ticket for getting caught with a certain amount or less. I don't smoke so I don't pay attention to the actual numbers, but it is only a ticket now for that amount or less. It is considered decriminalized for that amount, and I guess it's the same as it doesn't make you a criminal to get a speeding ticket.

I mean it would be silly to try to eliminate a black market by taxing it like that, it would just keep the black market going. The price of marijuana as a whole would go down so I guess the taxing would all be relative. The business owners trying to profit from the new laws would not go for a tax like that, there would be no incentive to open up shop.

You're confusing the Constitution with federal law. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and it applies to the states and federal government equally. Federal laws are supposed to be based on authority granted to the federal government by the Constitution. The Constitution specifies which powers the feds have and don't have. If they have a certain power then they can make federal laws on the issue and those laws would trump state laws. If they don't then they aren't supposed to be making laws on the issue and it should be left to the states (unless the Constitution prohibits the states from having the power as well). With the marijuana issue, the feds have argued that regulating pot is a power they have under the commerce clause and the Supreme Court has agreed (not everyone else does). Thus, even if a state makes medicinal marijuana legal under state law, federal law still applies.

time to focus on the obama admin. maybe if we let all the pot heads out of prison ... oh wait, NO!but you should have known, with biden's record. the enslavement of innocent pot smokers will continue

The smart move is to take *some* weed, then drive back around and make sure that you get the same guy at the drive-thru, and give him the bag back and ask for the right order. Say you don't want anything to do with what you had, but you just want your food and call it a day.Then don't report anything. If this guy goes to jail for 2 years, you know where he's going when he comes out.

So he basically got a death penalty for weed! Only in USA! And the "life without parole" is a death penalty, just not one where the state executes you but you are sentenced to die in prison and will never be released. If you must die in prison, it is a death penalty.

Due to federal laws banks, credit unions and insurance companies can not provide services to the pot industry. So, if your employer tried using direct deposit they would not be allowed too, however, since you're getting paid in cash you should be able to open a bank account.

And socially liberal. His views on marijuana decriminalization would gain him some liberal fans. As would his views on the wars, but his views on social programs will kill him with the left and the middle, they're rather extreme and people just aren't ready to give up Social Security and Medicare. He's probably the best the conservatives have to offer. I'd actually be pleased to see him win the republican nomination; though I'm not sure it'll happen, he's probably not right enough for the right.

Actually, if it was legalized, I bet processing companies would start up, and marijuana cigarettes would start popping up, so you could buy them by the pack, pre-rolled. The Govt would tax by the pack too, probably the same amount as cigarettes, if not more.Then you have other industries like pipes, bongs, vaporizers, etc, which would really take off.

> Why is it a difficult decision to tell someone else what they are allowed to do with their own body.this is not a popular opinion but i'm not one that thinks that you own your own body. it's an extremely complicated thing that i really don't want to get into right now because i could write pages and pages on it, but overall i think that we're a society, not a collective of individuals, and so some choices can be made at the perceived detriment of individuals if it harms society.whether this applies to marijuana, drugs, whatever, or not, i can't tell you for sure. but it simply does not work on me to say "well it's my body" because i don't see that as evidence.however, criminalization for things against the collective society **is** stupid, regardless. i can agree there.

I don't know why people are saying Obama would easily win against Ron Paul in the general election. First of all Ron Paul would get close to every single republican vote(half the country). Even through a lot of mainstream republicans(neocons) don't like some of Ron Paul's views, they would choose Paul over Obama. Not only would Paul get 98%+ of the conservative vote, he would have a large number of independents and democrats voting for him. Paul would win over more leftists and independents everyday leading up to the election because he is anti-war, pro-civil rights and pro-marijuana legalization.. unfortunately Obama is none of those things.

Depending on the dose the come up can be kind of annoying effects wise. I tend to get the shakes pretty bad, and my body has a hard time regulating my temperature. Lots of putting on/off different jackets and blankets.Otherwise, during the actual trip I've found it wonderful and very easy to deal with. The headspace is definitely psychedelic in nature, but it's very forgiving and manageable. Depending on the dose, it's sometimes underwhelming mentally, so I usually throw in some weed or a dissociative to make it more interesting mentally.Visually speaking though, it's one of the best compounds I've had the pleasure of trying.It's really quite special IMO, as it can be used for a fantastic recreational experience, or it can be used for a deep therapeutic experience, depending on dose, set/setting, etc.

Oh, and another friend, I gave 5 grams too, literally just *Gave*, I wouldn't sell cause, well, dealing's bad, and I got it for free, and I loved her, one of my best friends, so, yeah, and I also gave her a couple bottles of wine I had gotten from my uncle that I didn't like, well, her mum found them. Immediately she said 'Kasey gave it all to me, I don't even know what it is!'. She was banned from seeing me ever again and her mum called and told my mum what happened and bitched her out. My mum knew all of this already, so she told her to fuck right off. Then told me to never give weed away again cause that's what happens. Saw her mum in the market a couple days later and she started freaking out at me. I was kind of a bitch and had quite the temper then so I screamed right back at her and told her she's a crazy cunt, and if I ever see her daughter outside of school again I'd destroy her, and that her daughter has drank more than I ever have - had literally tried it once at that point, didn't like it - and that her daughter was borderline alcoholic. we were 16, by the way. Was lovely. There's other stories, but eh. All the friends I've ever had that smoked pot have fucked me over in some way, or attempted to... It's just shitty.

And if there is anything the state needs, its desperate drug addicts. They are the safest people around, and don't cause any crime. Edit - I think people are missing my point - taking state aid away from people that need it makes them desperate. People who are addicted to drugs (obviously we are not talking pot here) are going to want to feed their addiction, but now they don't have money at all. They are more likely to turn to crime now.

Can people please stop calling this stuff "synthetic marijuana"? It does not contain synthetic versions of any active chemical found in cannabis. It contains chemicals that may be synthetic, but are only designed to act in similar ways as the chemicals in cannabis. If it were truly "synthetic marijuana" it would be just as illegal as the chemicals found naturally in the cannabis plant.

Ok, I'm game. Explain how prostitution is a moral crime in a completely secular society?On your second point, I agree that it is dictatorial to impress my beliefs on others. Which is why I make an effort not to. However, saying that we don't as a society doesn't change the nature of what is true. How many people are in jail for marijuana-related crimes? Can anyone make an argument that those laws weren't written by someone with a misguided sense of principles? How can we say that something is true, when it clearly is not? We make moral decision for other people every single time we legislate something that doesn't hurt someone else.TL;DR: I agree with your principle, but in practice I still think you're wrong.

The cost of weed doesn't come from the cost of production, if you could grow it legally you could produce it as cheaply as you do any outdoor plant. The cost of business comes from having to avoid detection, creating a smaller supply and a greater risk which requires a larger profit to entice one to grow. You could get low quality seeds for damn near free, all it takes is time.

That's what I hear, too. I got the impression that decrim. was pretty much a done deal until the Harper government got in. Lots of pending legislation gets chucked when the new clowns join the circus, anyway, but this one was was up there on the list for *them* probably. I don't doubt for a minute though, the weed thing was just a Grit bone to throw as a distraction from all their shenanigans.

From my understanding, they may try, and you may need to get a lawyer but you should win the case even if they found something on you because they shouldn't have had probable cause to begin with.Linkshttp://cannabisnews.com/news/5/thread5828.shtml - Says smell from a car may be enough for probable cause, but not your person smelling of ithttp://slog.thestranger.com/2008/07/smell_of_marijuana_is_insufficient_cause - not enoughhttp://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=6112 - Says it isn't enough, even in vehiclehttp://jonathanturley.org/2011/04/23/odor-of-marijuana-not-enough-for-probable-cause/ - not enough even in a vehiclehttp://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/01/marijuana_smell_search.php - says it is enough in a vehicleLooks like maybe just don't do it in your car and you will be ok.

So many things. Off the top of my head:One guy got arrested while at work (for failing to pay child support... Yeah, fast food salaries don't really afford child support payments). The police even waited for him to finish his shift. He was back at work a couple days later.A couple of employees had sex on one of the prep counters. Not fired.The janitor was caught eating frozen Chicken tenders in the freezer. Not fired.Finally, one guy threatened a coworker with a fryer basket dripping with oil and threatened me with a knife (for not letting him eat about $30 worth of food for free). I resigned the next day after he was not fired. Apparently night shift employees are very valuable.That same manager was later fired for smoking pot on the roof. Go figure.

I'm not saying there do not exist negative side effects, just that there have not been any conclusive studies done by non-biased sources that prove there are any negative effects on your health. It just happens to be the case that many people believe in nonexistant side effects that have no tested basis, and were made up by the media and big businesses to keep weed from being legalized.

>There aren't many products that can compete with cannabis in an actual free, capitalistic market. So, legalizing cannabis would introduce competition that existing mega-corporations who lobby to politicians don't want.The problem I have with this premise is the fact that cannabis has to be a competing product to anything. Who would stop Pfizer or Phillip Morris from entering the market? Tobacco companies (and possibly drug companies) are in the best position to enter the market immediately. Cigarette manufacturers *already* have the infrastructure!

I can tell you, from experience, when I used to smoke weed, I rarely drank. It was mostly when I wanted to try a craft beer or if I didn't have any weed. Now I don't smoke and I drink more often, because I can't smoke! I don't have an alcohol problem, but I definitely noticed an increase in drinking when I stopped smoking.Also, the only time my friends ever drove high (I never did it, always too paranoid) was when they wanted to get high somewhere discreet, then go home/to the movies/to a diner, whatever. If it was legal to smoke, people won't travel to get high, because they won't worry about being caught! That's just my opinion though...

Even tho you can't go to a dispensary, and people can't legally *sell* you marijuana...you can legally buy it off the black market. It's very easy to find someone [on craigslist](http://denver.craigslist.org/search/?areaID=13&subAreaID=&query=mmj+64&catAbb=sss) willing to do a deal. And, as you can see, a lot of these folks have a decent selection. It's not the full experience, but probably a lot better than what you're used to.

pretty formula's do not mean they are being used correctly or that the conclusions based on the results are accurate. Nor does it guarantee that the study was done while factoring in all the relevant things that can influence what you are looking at.When you leave out those factors you are getting correlation. They largely ignored economic factors that happened exactly during the time they got all of their data.There are sociological factors that are not predictable unless weed was legalized more universally. They even admit that these factors could have a large impact on the study and their conclusions.If they did take more into account and the come out with similar numbers, then it's believable. But otherwise you are just looking at the correlation of two data sets that seem to match up well.

Barack Obama has absolute executive authority to determine the policy of the Drug Enforcement Administration when it comes to conducting raids and prosecuting for drug-related offenses. He commands Attorney General Eric Holder whose official stance on marijuana is that [the government will prosecute people for marijuana use even if it is completely legal](http://reason.com/blog/2010/10/15/holder-to-california-potsmoker), a stance which Obama has permitted to go on public record with no objection. Obama has the authority to order drug raids to stop; this is a job he chose to take; however, he demands that the raids continue.

But I dont get why I should stop something that feels so good. I dont drink or smoke weed anymore or break any other laws. Why cant I do this one thing?

Well, the reason weed IS a gateway drug, is because it is illegal. The people you have to get it from may have other things for you to be curious about. If the government sold me pot, I wouldn't even have access to any other ones, without a hook up. Despite all of this, I'm pretty sure that even if I had never tried pot, I would have tried *something*

> schedule 1 narcoticCannabis is schedule 1? Were they high when they made that list?According to Wikipedia, a schedule 1 drug requires the following>The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.> The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.> There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.Which, tbh, sounds like triple bullshit, even if you disagree with the legalization of cannabis.

> I got searched anyway because they deemed my refusal to be searched suspicious.The most they can legally do is a pat down to make sure you aren't carrying weapons. They can't do a full on search without probable cause and refusal to consent to a search does not give them probable cause. Of course if you smell like pot, that is probable cause to search you. Since there is no way to record a smell, they can use this reason to search you if you act suspicious. So just keep your cool and don't act suspicious.

End prohibition of all drugs. The effects the drug has on the person should not even be an argument to end prohibition. It's simply not anyone's place to tell me what I can and cannot put in my body. End the prohibition of cannabis. End the prohibition of mushrooms. End the prohibition of LSD. End the prohibition of cocaine. Hell! Even end the prohibition of methamphetamine. If someone wants to do meth, they will do meth, regardless of the law.

Super short list because I was bored, hardly does anyone any justice:*Christianity: Jesus is God and died on the Cross for your sins. Protestant: You must seek forgiveness and God will provide it. Also you can read and interpret the Bible on your own. Catholic: God decides to forgive you for your sins, you cannot. Also, the Church as a holy institution interprets things.*Atheism: No god. Variations of this.*Islam: Allah gave to the Prophet Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him) a special revelation that is not corrupt unlike previous versions. Follow the Pillars of Islam.*Buddhism: All life is Suffering, the Buddha laid out a path to escape endless reincarnation.*Judaism: Covenantal faithfulness to God and community via ritual and shared culture.*Hinduism: Many variations. Many/One/None gods/goddess may/may not ordain rituals and practices that lead to a variety of goals the ultimate one being to escape the cycle of rebirth.*Pagan: Again to many to shorten. Many gods/goddess who are worshiped in accordance to tradition and inspiration. Honor the Earth.*Rastafarian: Haile Selassie I was God, ie Second Coming of Christ. Reject Western society, cannabis is a divine gift for mediation.*Agnostic: Maybe a god.*Native American: Varies. Many gods/goddess and a focus on traditional places over time and events.*Mormonism: Joseph Smith found a new New Testament that teaches family and community importance and a strong moral code.*Baha'i: Bahaullah was given a unique revelation after Islam that was the most current. Humanity will evolve to spiritual perfection someday.

You just admitted that Mario Urioste wasn't a monster. I doubt he was the only non-violent offender there. When you keep murderers, thugs, rapists, and other violent criminals with non-violent offenders (shop lifters, weed-smokers, etc.) you expose them to violence that can cause them to turn to more violence once they are released from prison.

I've been smoking pot pretty much daily since 1984 and I have no complaints. I used to smoke cigarettes, but quit in 1999.I guess I should add that I jog daily.I just checked out the government anti-cannabis website http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/marijuana.html and if they had any hard science to prove it's bad for your lungs they'd have it there.>Effects on the Lungs>Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increases the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;8 **however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.9 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.**>Nonetheless, marijuana smokers can have many of the same respiratory problems as tobacco smokers, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, a heightened risk of lung infections, and a greater tendency toward obstructed airways. A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers.10 Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.Notice they don't have any citations when they say cannabis smoking can cause respiratory problems or when they say cannabis users' increased absenteeism is because of respiratory illness? I call bullshit.

There are 99 reasons to hate Newt Gingrich.Here's one:He supported the death penalty for marijuana trafficking.Stop. This isn't about whether or not you think marijuana should be legal. I said he supported the **death penalty** for marijuana trafficking.Did you get that? No, I didn't just say he supported sending people to *prison* for marijuana trafficking. I said **death penalty**.The fucking **death penalty**He is a fucking psychopath.

Foster parent to drug exposed infants here...If they screen your baby and detect drugs in the baby's system at birth, your baby will be immediately removed from your care and put into a foster home. Period. This is where all of the babies we've had in our house come from.EDIT: it seems marijuana is not listed in the MN statutes for "prenatal exposure" drugs - so they might not take the baby for that reason.

> We see lawlessness and killings in other parts of the world, and now and then we send troops over. Very rarely does the US send troops to violent countries. Burma, North Korea, most of Africa, portions of the Middle East, a couple of countries in South America, and of course Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia could all be labelled as violent. Recently, the US has sent troops to Bosnia (under UN mandate), Somalia (as part of a humanitarian mission that ended badly), and Iraq (without any mandate to find WMDs that weren't there), and Afghanistan (to find Osama bin Laden, who is still free). You should consider the effect that US troops inside Mexico without invitation would have on the "rather large" Mexican and Latin population living in the US. > However, my guess is it is becoming more and more corrupt every day. Corruption isn't equal to violence is it? If there was complete corruption (i.e. the drug cartels controlled the government) then the drug cartels would not need to kill government officials. All things being equal, if violence is increasing, you could reason that corruption is decreasing. > And now we have to worry about the violence spilling over our borders. This "spilling over" creates a false image of a problem originating completely in Mexico. If you closed the border completely (almost impossible), and then stopped the drug flow completely (also impossible) you would still have organised crime elements present in (according to this article) over 200 cities in the US. They're already in the US and they're not leaving. > ... let's end the drug war that is fueling the violence in *both* our countries. Let's say that tomorrow, both the US and Mexico legalised cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy and methamphetamines, do you really think that these well trained, well organised groups that are present in *both* our countries would just give up and go back to farming? Legalisation is a false panacea. It may reduce the problem, but there will be unintended consequences.

It's not really decriminalized. You can still get arrested for smoking in public. Even worse, you can get arrested for having "dirty" paraphernalia. Yes, possession of a bag of marijuana will be decriminalized, but if that marijuana is on a bowl, or a pipe (even if you are not smoking it), then you can still be arrested.Also, it would only be decriminalized for the first two offenses. After that, you can get arrested.

No, that's completely different then someone driving drunk and killing someone or someone driving high and getting in a car crash. Obviously it may not have happened if it weren't for the drug, but does that mean that drinking alcohol should be completely illegal because people can drive drunk, when driving drunk itself is illegal?If weed was legal, driving under the influence would be like driving drunk, illegal and frowned upon. Obviously it impairs your driving, which is why you smoke responsibly rather than driving while high or drunk. That doesn't mean the drug itself should be illegal.

First off, I'm a conservative leaning Libertarian. Putting someone in jail for life for petty offenses is just dumb to me. Life in prison should be reserved for severe offenses, not for someone caught with pot 3 times. (drastic example, but proves a point)

Seriously... does nobody realize that penny stocks do not move rationally? It's all a get a rich quick scheme timed by good traders and a few lucky people. If any stock like a medical marijuana stock was to blow up, then just wait til it becomes legitimate before you invest and save yourself a few hundred in losses first. Stocks like MJNA do not even publicize their information. You don't even know if they have the cash to sustain their business or if it's even growing.

To get the same level of insurance that banks do, credit unions are backed by the National Credit Union Administration, which was created by congress and must follow federal banking laws. The refusal from banks to deal in the marijuana industry is because doing so risks losing NCUA or FDIC insurance. The other option is to create a private bank or credit union, with independent insurance.

[I'm not convinced that would be the case](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/07/how_much_would_legal_marijuana_cost_a_new_book_says_it_would_be_nearly_free_.html). Its currently so expensive because its illegal, dealers can charge what they want because where else are you going to get it? Part of the price is the risk growers/sellers take. Its really not a difficult plant to grow, granted high quality strains take a bit more care but its just an herb that most would be able to grow a little in their garden no problem.

There are prisoners in there for rape. This is where they put the animals of society. I think they should have a separate system for different crimes. A jail for only violent offenders is an example. Someone with a weed conviction shouldn't be locked up with serious murderers and rapists.

Do you have a source for this claim? **Specifically**: do you have a source that backs up the claim that people who smoke marijuana have a higher tendency to commit other non-marijuana crimes? Because this sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me. The article I linked basically directly refutes your claim.

I'm not sure exactly why this poll is so weird, but to call it propaganda in the sense that CNN is trying to whitewash support for marijuana legalization seems off base.The incentive for a news organization, in this case CNN, would not be to report on a poll that largely maintains the status quo opinion but instead in the poll that shows a majority favoring marijuana legalization. In other words, "Majority Still Against Marijuana Legalization" would not be nearly as beneficial in terms of traffic and general buzz as "Majority Supports Marijuana Legalization."This is probably just a case of looking to deep into one poll. CNN does tons of poll I'm sure we could find plenty of them that ask these questions that do it correctly.

Just think, then the children get to be raised by a good and loving state-approved foster home. The children, it's all about the children.

I think the claim that crime is down 15% is somewhat spurious anyways. I do think crime has probably been steady or perhaps even down a bit since legalization. As far as legalization itself decreasing the crime rate directly, I don't think that it would have much impact because possession of small amounts of marijuana had already been decriminalized in Colorado since 1973 The crime numbers that they are using for the decrease in crime are specifically property crimes in Denver for the period January-March 2014 compared to January-March 2013. Not only is the time period to short to show a trend, they focused only on the type of crime that saw the biggest decrease and ignored the other areas of crime. Over that period some types of crime saw a decrease some saw an increase, but again the time period was too short to see any kind of trend.

Almost no marijuana case goes to trial. You'll almost always plead guilty.The reason you plead guilty is because your defense lawyer knows you'll lose. To convict on marijuana possession, all you need to prove is that the person had the weed on their person. They don't even need to have known it was there. The mere fact that the cops found it on you proves the entire case.If I were a public defender or a defense attorney (I'm a law student), I would tell my client to plead guilty to get favorable treatment. If you go to trial, you'll get a much harsher fine/sentence.

You can always try beta blockers for short acting relief if you are worried about the addictive nature of benzos. I take propanolol in conjunction with my benzos for anxiety.Beta blockers help to take away the physical symptoms of anxiety. They give them often to people who have stage fright and stuff like that. I usually take them when I know I am heading into a situation that is going to be stressful for me.I also take Klonopin (2mg) AM and PM with 2 as needed per day and Xanax (2mg) as needed for panic attacks.I usually don't take all of the Klonopin, as the AM/PM regimen keeps my baseline pretty well regulated. I have had to take increasingly larger doses of benzos over the past two years as I have gotten used to lower doses/lesser meds.The Xanax is a recent addition, added by my psychiatrist when I agreed to stop self medicating with pot lol.

Yes opiates suppress cortisol your stress hormone, to much cortisol wears the immune system down, when you quit all the suppression leads to large releases of cortisol for awhile until your body adjusts. Ashwagandha is an herb that regulates cortisol and helps a lot of other things like sleep and anxiety. I'd recommend it, I'd also recommend eating yogurt or probiotic pills for the GI issues, it will help.

If hemp were made legal, there would be A LOT less pollution, as it can be used for paper/rope/clothing/food/oil etc. "The potential of hemp for paper production is enormous. According to the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, one acre of hemp can produce 4 times more paper than one acre of trees! All types of paper products" It also only gives off a quarter of the pollution.

Obama is Bush's third term. Obama didn't end the Iraq war. The Iraq war only ended because Iraq refused to give US troops immunity past the date that Bush set for withdraw. Obama wanted to keep us in there longer. How pathetic and ironic that we only finally left Iraq according to Bush's timetable.Obama has kept prosecuting pot smokers in spectacular fashion, despite promises not to bother them anymore.Obama has been complicit with Eric Holders Fast and Furious disaster. At the least Obama should call for Holder to be fired and put on trial. But no, Obama is keeping him around. Obama continued Bush's banker bailouts, and kept around the same Wall St. goons that Bush appointed. So if you want Bush to have a fourth term (he's already had three), vote Obama!

I am an OK resident who smoked for a long time (not anymore though). I admit I have driven drunk. I have driven high. I have driven under the influence of prescription drugs (oxy, etc). While I don't support driving under the influence of anything at anytime, I have to say that driving while under the influence of marijuana is absolutely nothing compared to driving drunk. Yes they are both dangerous. The safety of driving while under the influence should have nothing to do with the argument for legalization because of the overwhelming dangers of driving drunk. People who make the argument against legalization and use the driving while stoned issue hold absolutely no credibility in my mind.

Basically you're saying 'I don't use *illegal* drugs, all the drugs I use are legal, therefore I don't consider them drugs'.Also, saying "x uses drugs" is very vague.

We cannot specifically suggest a medical professional to seek for a medical cannabis recommendation, unfortunately.

There is something called the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution which declares that states must follow federal law when a conflict arises between federal law and the laws of any state. The DOJ will likely sue the state in a federal court over the law and use the Supremacy Clause as grounds to have the law overturned. The marijuana laws you a referring to are still illegal under federal law. So the DOJ could sue to have the laws overturned and there could even be federal prosecution of individual violators. So far, the federal government has chosen not to act.

Less power? Perhaps. But there *are* other non-drug crimes and other drugs to sell, and the cartels will not be out of business. They *will* focus on other things. What they won't do is just magically disappear because of an end to marijuana prohibition (and I'm for ending the prohibition). I just don't expect the violence from Mexican cartels to stop when marijuana is no longer a lucrative commodity to them.

One time I went to a party with my cousin just outside London in England. The party started off fine, just 10-20 people drinking cans/vodka and smoking spliff; standard stuff. Then the girl who was hosting it called her boyfriend, who came over with 20 of his friends. Those friends invited more friends. By about half 11 there were at least 150 people there. In a regular suburban house. The girl who was hosting it got overwhelmed by this and locked herself in her room crying. While this was going on, someone left the shower and the bath on (the bath went through the floor and landed in the living room), kicked in the front door (with £800+ worth of stained glass) and set her couch on fire. We kicked in her bedroom door and she was lying on her bed crying. The police came and kicked everyone out, the most aggressive people were arrested but most of us get away, but then half an hour later we all ended up coming back because the front door had the lock kicked in so she couldn't lock us out. Ended up having a huge rave in her house. All crockery, ornaments etc broken. TV thrown out the 2nd story window. 5 guy brawl resulting in a mirror being broken over a guy's face.TL;DR: Crazy party. Host locks herself in bedroom. Bath goes through ceiling, front door kicked in, police come. Arrests made, we come back, tv thrown out window, mirror smashed over a guy's face.

That's true - civil rights are universal but the phrase has a heavy connotation of racial equality. Considering he used "civil rights activist" as a term to distinguish itself from "legalized marijuana activist" I assumed he was using a narrow construction of "civil rights" that was possibly constrained to MLK-era activism.

I was twenty and went to my drug dealers house to pick up some weed . Excited of how it looked and smelled i walked out of his house dancing. I get in the car and as i pull into the road a cop is parked hidden behind a bush with his lights on hardly leaving me with any room to make my turn. I instantly looked at my friend with the expression of "well fuck" as the cop proceeded to pull into the driveway and turn around. Long story short we both went to jail that night.

I'm finally pulling my head out of my ass.After not getting into my college of choice last year, I took a year off, and it was an unbelievable learning experience. I worked near full time for a while, lost my job (due to stupidity). Tried weed and kept at it for a couple of months. Stopped when I lost the job. Temp job jumped for a bit, took LSD, first seldom, now consistently. Working full time, going to a University in the fall, have housing arrangements planned out, just need to sign up for classes, and be on with my life.Getting over my baggage issues. The girls I so desperately loved that did not feel the same way, I am now getting over, realizing they don't matter to me anymore. I'm interested in a relationship, but don't *need* one. A gal will come along that will make up for all the hardships I have faced in the past, and I will make sure she is rightfully treated as such.I truly believe this small time period is when my life begins to change for the better.

He plans to pay for free college with a .5% tax on Wall Street transactions, which actually should leave a surplus. His plan to fund paid family leave is through a .2% payroll tax increase. His plan to pay for healthcare is a little more complex. It would require an across the board tax increase on everyone, but the tax increase would be less than what you are currently paying for healthcare, as it would save about $400 billion in administration fees. His infrastructure plan hasn't had a funding plan released yet, but, if we look at the tax revenue from states that have legalized marijuana, it would more than likely give us more money than his infrastructure plan would cost, and his infrastructure plan would also create 5 million jobs, which would stimulate the economy. His college plan also creates a better educated work force, which will stimulate the economy.

It says that the doctor can recommend medical marijuana if either A) Regular medical therapies and opiates don't seem to work or B) regular medical therapies and opiates are contraindicated (meaning it would either be harmful or isn't worth looking into because the costs would outweigh the benefits. This also prevents a doctor from becoming a legalized naturopath who could dismiss patients by telling them to just get stoned instead of trying real proven medical treatments first.

No, probable cause alone is not enough to search. If they have only probable cause, they need to get a warrant or consent in order to search. Probable cause + exigent circumstances is enough to search without a warrant. A vehicle in which one smells marijuana is one such exigent circumstance. Here are some of the exceptions to the warrant requirement: http://nationalparalegal.edu/conlawcrimproc_public/protectionfromsearches&seizures/extowarrantreq.asp

there are only a small minority of people that want all guns banned in this country...but there are plenty of ways common sense gun control could make this country safer...the problem is the NRA fights any and all gun control the same as if it was a bill stripping American's of all weapons. Also comparing smoking pot to gun control is a pretty flimsy comparison. BTW I am a gun owner...there actually are plenty of us that think you can shoot for sport, hunt and protect a house while cracking down gun crime, and limiting the types of weapons available.

all I know is they have to have probable cause or driver's consent to search the car. If you deny them the clearance (simply say, "I do not consent to any searches" at any mention of the cop entering your vehicle) to search your car and they can't find any probable cause (even something as stupid as red eye or smell) then they can still call in a K9 unit for backup. At this point ask the cop if you are being detained, you most likely are, but if he says no then you are free to go. If you do have to stay around for the dog to show up, it is legally allowed to sniff around the car, he will most likely pick up your weed giving probable cause to search your car and then you are most likely screwed.

My apologies for not knowing the name of the country Darfur is in, but African politics has frustrated me so much all my life, that I simply don't read the articles any more.Guerrilla movement performs a half coup, disabling or hindering the official government. Then said Guerrilla group spends next decade stealing the supplies we send for the innocent people of the country.Eventually there will be some peacekeeping force sent in, but it will be much too late, their economy will a shambles. Then we have adverts to adopt pot bellied african kids on TV for another 10 years.That isn't to say they don't have my deepest sympathies. But when I know my government will intervene, regardless of the cash raised by independant charities, using my tax money to pay for it. Then I have little need to donate.Paramountly though, the "Your donation will fund our crucial awareness and advocacy programs" can at best be interpretted as "We'll use your $2500 donation to fly around the country talking to politicians that already know whats going on". There is no reference to direct aid from the donations that I can see. So you're money is going into the wallet of some green peace jack-off that wants to ban steak...

Soooo, since alcohol has been proven time and again to be a poison in every way (albeit a fun poison), and since cannabis has been proven to be nothing of the sort (the exact opposite of alcohol, apparently), why exactly are things still the way they are regulations-wise?Not that I think any government should ever be allowed to dictate what you can or can't put into your body, but wouldn't it make waaay more sense to regulate the booze and let people consume cannabis at will?

It's not that.He was drunk and high on Xanax and weed when he was pulled over for drag-racing. So when they brought him to the hospital for the piss-test, they have to film you actually peeing into the cup. Since they have to watch you, apparently they also have to film you down here. If they film it, it's public record by law.

No. It does not bother me because those people are breaking the law.I do not agree with marijuana laws. I think it is a waste of resources.I do not agree with many laws. That does not change the fact that they are the law. I am not a judge or a congressman. My job is to enforce the laws on the books.

I've just found the Portuguese stats. The interesting fact is that the lifetime usage went up while the annual usage was stable. This suggests more people experimenting but no more habits being formed.Also cannabis use dropped a fair chunk (on an annual basis) among the youngest user group.Another interesting stat is for the older groups all drug use increased slightly (annually).Regardless the stats show a huge decrease in death rate. We're talking about a 50% drop https://fullfact.org/factchecks/Portugal_decriminalisation_drugs_effects-3276

Far from united? Almost every single American citizen considers themselves as American. That's the amazing part. The US has the most immigrants in the world, and is the most ethnically diverse country in the world, but yet almost everybody that lives in the US, considers themselves as American.And as for marijuana legalization, over 55% of Americans support legalization, compared to only 30% during the 1990s. You have no idea what you're talking about.

>Like what are we supposed to think of gays, what if when i have a son he becomes gay? Do i try to persuade him to become straight?There is not one hegemonic Christian interpretation of this. Some Christians recommend loving gays and lesbian, while still thinking it is a sin, while others (such as myself) are staunchly pro-gay. I personally believe same-sex marriages should be sanctified by the Church.>And why does God say that "the only way to me is through my son", does this mean that if you don't believe and follow Jesus Christ then you would not be permited to heaven?Actually, a Jewish man wrote that, not God.>Is it wrong if i think im agnostic? Because i do believe in a God, and i do believe that there is only one God not multiple (like in ancient egyptian/greek religions).Agnostics doubt the existence of God, so I doubt you are agnostic.>And is smoking pot or doing drugs against out religion?Christian ethics generally advocate moderation. While I would not recommend taking drugs for secular reasons, so as long as drugs do not become habitual I do not perceive it as anti-Christian. >And why would it be wrong to get a tattoo or piercings? And if altering the body is against out religion then why do girls still pierce their ears?It is not wrong. Those rules were set up by the ancient Israelites to distinguish themselves from other tribes.

A question for our (US) presidential and vice-presidential candidates:The prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s created a black market in which organized crime flourished. Al Capone had his heyday. Ending the prohibition of alcohol eliminated to large extent the black market, and undercut organized crime.Today marijuana is prohibited, and the lucrative black market is the source of major profits for organized crime. Marijuana is a less addictive substance than alcohol, and like alcohol is used responsibly by a majority of the people who indulge in it. Why don't we undercut organized crime now as we did back then, by ending prohibition and moving to a system of state-based regulation? What has worked for alcohol will work for marijuana, and organized crime can be hit hard by cutting off its major source of profit.

ATTENTION ALL REDDITORS: If you are charged with misdemeanor pot possession in Cook County know that the prosecutors will NOT be able to prove their case in court. They never force the chemists to come to court on misdemeanor pot cases because they are too busy.So, as long as you plead NOT GUILTY and refuse to STIPULATE to the laboratory tests, the states attorneys will dismiss the case. They will attempt to get you to plead guilty for drug school or some BS but don't. JUST PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND RUN.

Most of the people who I know that smoke weed all the time quit doing all the things they used to do to have fun and don't really know how to have fun without being high anymore run on sentence.

No, hemp just got another reason to be *banned.*Hemp can be used to make paper, so it has to be banned for the paper industry.Hemp can be used to make clothing, so it has to be banned for the cotton industry.And now hemp can be used to make biofuel, so it has to be banned for the oil industry.

The regs are the laws. The ballot initiative authorized *personal* use and possession and established a regulatory framework for commercial operations. Since those regs are still being written, no cannabis businesses are legal yet.

since high school alot of my friends have been smoking weed and i don't really care as long as they don't expect me to hang out with them when they are going to smoke and so far they smoke when they want to smoke and i don't really care. So imo there is nothing wrong with it i think it should be legal

Do you have a management company? IANAL, but can imagine a management company taking on that risk themselves, and being a sort of release for the actual owner. As in, the owner could possibly sue for any losses due to failure on the part of the company. (so use a company with assets...)Re: California marijuana. Probably nothing to worry about unless they've turned it into a major grow house. :D Aside from that, have you looked into holding the house in a trust or corporate entity, rather than as a personal asset subject *to your personal legal issues? All depends on your situation, but if it's substantial money, might be worth looking into.

They did experiments with cannabis on mice .on young mice ( not fully developed brains) there was chronic short term memory loss.With adult mice ( fully developed brain) there was short term memory loss but it was Not chronic.research is key.I smoke trees and it should be legal. People should be informed.

The reason why this happens is not that AstraZeneca has managed to convince people with unipolar depression that they in fact have bipolar disorder or even that they are trying to do so. Some - probably bogus - studies have suggested that Seroquel can be used as an adjunctive to SSRIs to improve their efficacy. My understanding of pharmacology doesn't suggest such an effect, but on the other hand, I do not have a PhD in medicine. It is also useful in some cases as a treatment for insomnia and there is no calling into question its somnolent effect (although one can, for various reasons, very well question whether or not it promotes deep, restful sleep - not the least of which being that it can cause swelling of the nasal passages which is extremely uncomfortable).If there is one desirable effect of Seroquel for depressed or neurotypical people, however, it's that with long-term usage or high doses it can give rise to dopamine receptor upregulation, thereby enhancing libido and increasing one's sensitivity to amphetamines and other dopamingergics (that includes marijuana).It's pure hell being on the drug, though. It can produce severe dysphoria and will (temporarily of course) make you extremely stupid, unmotivated, and generally give you a majority, if not all, of the negative symptoms of Schizophrenia. (When I say "negative symptoms" I don't mean "bad symptoms" (although they are bad) but rather symptoms which are produced by low dopamingergia in certain parts of the brain.)Edit: Oh, do NOT under any circumstances combine Seroquel with any dopamingergic.
