3052,0,"California born and raised. SoCal Native. Bay Area Refugee.SoCal Pros: After being away for three years in the bay area and returning for the new year visit, the landscape is lovely - tbh. Mountains, beaches, canyons, NATURE! i'm from the SF Valley where it's commonly called a shit hole, but now that i'm not living in it… it's rather nice. Couldn't wait to get out but now that I'm in San Francisco, I had a blast exploring the canyons by car and hiking trails by foot. WEATHER, obvi. The pot in SoCal is designer weed so its a lot stronger (bred that way) or more pot products are available. SoCal Cons: the people (get over yerself), the attitude, the nasty smog, the NASTY traffic, no sense of community. Emphasis on material needs and vanity. BOO.Mainly SF, CA...NorCal Pros: People are a lot nicer in SF. Probably because everyone's a transplant. Mild weather. A bit more progressive (but kind of falling behind in the times - conservative influence). Social programs. More sense of community. The herbs good and most people are accepting/participate in tokes. NorCal Cons: I spend most of my time in San Francisco where the cost of living is unbelievably expensive. Decent, affordable housing is impossible to find without having to live with 3-4 other people. The culture of a free loving SF is dying away with the wave of tech/privileged transplants moving in. The ban on public nudity (that's just SF, man… leave the nudists alone)! The desirable neighborhoods are those where most inhabitants are caucasian, $50K+ salary and have nothing to contribute to neighborhood issues. People feel self-entitled here. I used to think San Francisco was the best city in the world - in some sense it still is in certain aspects. But the working class cannot strive or survive here, sadly, which is why I think a lot of the culture and things you expect SF to be is disappearing slowly. /end rant/

3644,1,"In the US Constitution there is a clause called the Supremacy Clause. It basically means that federal law trumps state law. So, marijuana is still illegal. However, there is nothing requiring the state police to enforce federal laws.
"
3937,1,"Pot is rarely, if ever the issue here. The issue has several layers, and is complex. 1) Drugs make you worse at your job, weed, alcahol, heroin, etc.2) Alcohol is the only legal drug, and there is a long history of it being consumed on the American workplace, often times, still is (Barring cigarettes/coffee, etc)3) Alcohol is both social and culinary. You can have a nice beer with dinner or a glass of red wine, nobody says you have to be ""wasted"" Alcohol also brings people together in socially acceptable ways, ways society has long come to understand as normal and often positive4) Tests for Alcohol are expensive, and kinda pointless. Pot shows up in a person's system for weeks and even months ... Alcohol for hours on the cheaper tests and days on the very expensive ones.It is often times however, illegal to be drunk or high at work.

11195,1,"Hasn't this been hashed over enough? The guy was convicted of breaking the law. Obama didn't raid his pot growing business for funsies. Other dispensaries in CA are operating just fine because they are complying with the law.You can argue 10 years is too much and that pot should be legal and I'd agree, but whether knowingly or not this guy broke the law and is paying for it.
"
11260,1,"Yes +1 to this. I am aware of my own bias when it comes to these things so I tend to leave my opinion out. However, as an ex drug addict who is still recovering from the massive damage I did to my life, the naive pro drug crowd concerns me. I am also aware that people have to go through these things personally, I know that was the case with me. Ask yourself: Do you know any older people that still get high? Maybe smoke pot or drink, but you simply dont live long enough to keep poppin those beans or railing that oxy. And halucinogens, as much as I loved them at the time, I cant see myself wanting to do them again. They added a lot to my life, at the time, and I'm glad I experienced them, but you just grow out of it.TL;DR: As a hardcore ex drug addict, take it easy on the pro-drug propaganda. I can certainly defend some of the pros of legalization but most important is that the users themselves are well informed about the things they are doing to themselves, their body, and most importantly (in my case anyway) their minds. In my opinion you have the right to go ahead and experiment as much as you want, just keep a level head.

16417,1,"Ballot initiatives on controversial topic such as legalization, should be done in years when there is a presidential election as more young people typically come out to vote. I think its shitty but its just a fact, we would need the 18-30 crowd to come out and its not as likely in 2014 vs 2016. And since it costs so damn much to get an initiative on the ballot we don't want it to fail (ie California in 2010). If they waited 2 years they'd probably have legal herb. And 2016 also gives the organizers 2 more years to campaign and to raise awareness about how cannabis isn't dangerous and can be used responsibly.

Seriously, what the hell ARRL?They continue:> Obviously, depending on circumstances, approaching your neighbor in a case involving a grow light can be a potentially dangerous situation. They just got done saying that a grow light may or may not have to do with growing weed (especially in now *legalized* states, this article is out of date obviously). Now they are saying that confronting it is a dangerous situation. > For example, you may not want to directly approach a neighbor if you suspect a grow light is the source of your RFI problem. Now look at what you said:> I don't know many hams that care to stick their nose in your business.ARRL is advising hams to call the police before they talk to their neighbors.

25013,1,"LOL ... there is a state in the union that will be the very last to legalize medical weed and I'm in the one that will secede rather than become that state :-(. Honestly it is kind of whatever's around ... some strains work better than others, but it's hard to really know what you've got, like when you get from a dispensary ... what I've been told are primarily sativa strains are some of my favorites ... but again, sort of an unscientific answer ... sorry :-)
"
26891,1,"None of that matters, you still violated a rule. You can be an activist all you want, but at the end of the day, you broke a rule that wouldn't change whether or not marijuana is legal in your state. Alcohol is legal, but do they allow it in on campus dorms? No. Same goes for marijuana. If you were arrested for smoking on the street, this might be an appropriate response, but since you're in school and violated a school rule, this essay makes it look like you completely missed the point.TL;DR you broke a rule and wrote an irrelevant essay.

27449,1,"Old school hippies were politically active; it was a largely a political/social movement. Modern hippies tend to be more down with the drug side of that culture and less politically active. I guess it depends on how much you see marijuana legalization as a hot button political issue.

30600,1,"Haha nice. I was smoking with some friends in my buddy's car the other day while pulled off the side of the road and I go to take a hit and a cop rounded the corner and slowed to a stop and I thought I was fucked so I panicked and tried to throw the bag of weed but it wouldn't go very far because weed barely weighs anything so I tried to get out all fast to toss it father (all stupid in retrospect) then got back in to have my friends tell me he just kept going after he saw my friend smoking a cig. Fuck pigs. Have you tried vaporizing instead of smoking?
"
38814,1,"I don't know if I like that tactic though, because starting at a point of compromise just means that the bill will be watered down and we get the short end of the stick. For example, that's a good part of the reason we've made so little headway ending the war on drugs. The ones looking to end it suck at politics. They always start at a point of compromise in their debates and proposals. Rather than pushing for the absolute, complete legalization of all drugs, they only push for the low hanging fruit like cannabis. As a result we get lame ""compromises"" like medical marijuana. Instead we should be debating how legalized cocaine would affect addiction rates and how it would combat violence surrounding the drugs, while treating cannabis legalization as an unspoken common sense proposal.

40230,1,"i have one kid. and i wouldn't necessarily say strict.. but we aren't wealthy by any means. my boyfriend supports all 3 of us on his income. we buy high quality marijuana in a prohibition area so 1g is $20, between the two of us we smoke about 1.5- 2g a week depending on how much money we have to play around that month. boyfriend also smokes at least half a pack a day. boyfriend's hobby is drumming and mine is vidya so smoking is basically our ""hobby expense.""a dub of some (sorry op) mids a MONTH? pretty low for a daily smoker imo. i only smoke once a day but i will smoke about a gram a week.
"
43500,1,"I am not stuck on that stereotype at all. I live with 2 habitual users who are both educated and well employed. I also get to see a different type of use out of each of them. One is completely dependent and I have zero doubts could not function normally on a daily basis without smoking because he is self medicating mental health problems. The other is more recreational but even told me he uses to deal with depression and anxiety. I consider them both friends and great people but I also know both of them would be much better off appropriately handling their issues that cause their use to be more than just an occasional hobby.I agree that marijuana is better than tobacco (in the way it is marketed/modified today, not in a pure state) but that is like saying one bad thing is slightly better than another bad thing. I will also agree that is is better than alcohol also assuming we are being honest that neither is actually good for you. It is also kind of delusional to have this idea that marijuana users are these highly sophisticated people who are passionate about their use... most are no more educated on it and it's affects than the average drinker/tobacco smoker.Hemp has great potential, it could take my state of residence from one of the poorest to one of the richest in the country, but that is a maybe. I also caution so much optimism about legalization... companies like Camel and Marlboro will find a way to profit as much as possible and I am fully confident this would include adding nicotine to make it physically addicting to add to the mental dependency. They will also find ways to corner the market and prevent face-to-face methods of sale from being able to compete with them.Again... I just wish marijuana users would come to terms with the fact that what they do is completely by choice, unnecessary, and is not ""good"" for them. But again... that's merely my opinion.

43989,1,"Both. Lazy and I don't give a fuck attitude. The last illegal substance action taken against Diaz involving medical marijuana was because Diaz didn't file is paper work properly. The Nevada fighting Commission is very accommodating to those who hold legal marijuana licenses so long the fighter discloses this information before hand. Below is a quote from the suspension after his Condit loss.> During the hearing, Diaz admitted that marijuana does help him perform better during his training, as he's better able to focus and deal with his ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), for which he was prescribed a medical marijuana card.The commission also came after Diaz several times for his pre-fight medical questionnaire in which he answered “no” when questioned about being treated for any “serious medical conditions” and also failed to disclose his marijuana usage in the sections marked for prescribed or over-the-counter medications.

53642,1,"Here's the more complete story about me getting pulled over by a cop for a similar reason since I'm on my computer and not my phone anymore so its not a chore to type out something long.So my father and I had gone to a nice Audi Club drive throughout western Connecticut and some eastern New York I think, anyway it was in the Hudson River Valley area. So we left the meet when it culminated with a nice picnic at a beautiful park in Connecticut with a really awesome waterfall and some other stuff. I was driving down 684 going south in NY state when my dad told me that a cop had been pacing my driving. I thought it was a little odd since I had been going the actual speed limit but when I looked over at him, he gave me a thumbs up and then took off with his lights flashing. I saw him a few minutes later on the side of the road helping out a tow truck with a stalled car. As I went by I pushed the clutch in and revved it up to over 8,000 RPM to give him a nice exhaust note (this was before I bought a Magnaflow catback for the car even). So about 5 minutes later I see him flying up behind me with his lights on and he pulls me over. Comes up tot my window and something along the lines of damn this is a really awesome car and that he loved it not only for its sound and power but how it was bright yellow and stood out from most cars these days. He said that he wanted to purchase an RS6 for himself and asked me if we were going to be going to Waterfest that summer which we were. We talked about the car for about 15 minutes or so and when it was over, he told me when I pulled out onto the highway that I had to get on it hard, ""up to only the speed limit"" of course ;PWas a pretty neat thing to do but would have really sucked if say I was the kind of person to smoke a joint in their car and you wouldn't have had any legitimate reason to have been pulled over in the first place. I'm not sure what he would have done at that time had that been the case. So yeah, all in all it was a pretty interesting thing to have gone through.

So the reasonable thing would be to find a common (which can be difficult) point where you do become to intoxicated to drive and write laws based on that.Also the article talks about using these laws to prosecute someone who mixed alcohol with their prescription drugs and killing someone so obviously prescription drugs is a concern also being addressed.

"
78866,1,"I am curious of the argument that people have if they believe marijuana is truly harmless. Why would anybody vote for legalization if they don't want their own flesh and blood to come in contact with it? What's the difference if a child inhales a bit when he's 10 versus when he's 20 (considering he will not be harmed)? Do people still believe deep down that it's indeed a gateway drug? Of course you can trust _yourself_ not to move on to the heavier stuff, but what if your child just wants to try something a little 'heavier' one day in high school after he has grown resistant to even medical-grade cannabis? (After its legalization, the cheap low-grade marijuana won't be available anymore, it will be only the ""good stuff"", and when you grow resistant to the ""good stuff"" after a couple years, do you really have any choice but to move onto the next drug up the ladder? Stopping isn't a choice obviously, especially after all the fighting it took to get it legal in the first place.Is that really the reason people don't want their kids near it? To prolong the time it takes them to become resistant? It's obviously not because they think it will harm them, because it won't.

"
88023,1,"Unfortunately it's not that easy. The biggest problem is the stigma that comes with smoking weed. The stereotypical pot smoker is always being portrayed as a lazy, indifferent, filthy, late-hippie burn out with no ambitions and prospects in life other than laying on the couch, watching cartoons and eating fritos all day (nothing wrong with couch, cartoons or fritos; it's an awesome combo, IMO).The people that oppose the strongest are the ones that never experienced weed for themselves, and they just will not bend. You can throw a freight train full of medical research at them that backs up the invaluable benefits of weed, and they'll fight you on it. In their minds all pot smokers ""just wanna get high and sit on their asses"" and all the statistics are just an excuse to make it easier for the ""addicts"". It infuriates me to have a debate over this with one of these thick skulled assholes. So many sick people could be helped if they would just legalize it! But no, instead people get prescribed pharmaceuticals with an endless list of potential side effects (""this might help your depression a little, but you might have a stroke, heart attack or thoughts of suicide""), while the worst thing that could happen on weed is that they fall asleep on their couch or raid their fridge in a feeding frenzy. The horror!Now, of course, there ARE the potheads that really become useless once they hit the bong, neglect school and/or work, and turn semi-retarded.But, I have a lot of weed smokers in my circle of friends, family and at work that without a problem maintain steady jobs, happy relationships and a healthy social life. Interestingly enough, all of them work either in the educational field or in IT. They are highly functional people. Hell, my husband can be baked out of his mind and I wouldn't notice if he didn't tell me.Tell all this to the nay-sayers and they will just brush it off as an exception to the rule. They do not understand how weed works, that there are different strains that do different things, and that people that turn retarded on weed do so because they probably have a tendency to be lazy, immature and irresponsible, anyways. Ugh, it's so frustrating! /rant

"
96938,1,"The very short answer (there are tons more details, so don't take this as the final answer) is that the pot laws won't come into full effect until November 6, 2013 (one year after the election that passed the new pot laws). This one year gap was to allow them time to set up the rules and regulations around the legal sale of pot. The current status is as follows:1) It's legal to possess under and ounce and smoke it, but you can get a ticket for smoking in a public area (similar to the liquor ""open carry"" laws).2) There is no current legal way to buy pot except for medical marijuana. We should have a legal way to purchase pot on November 7th of this year, assuming everything works out and the Feds don't step in a cause a problem.
"
97183,1,"Here's my question on the ""taxable income"" part: Once you start adding taxes to the cost, and giving people the difference in pricing, who's going to buy higher priced weed? Currently, everyone that does weed can do so through already existing (generally illegal, unless you live in CO or WA) channels. That stuff is pretty cheap, the people who grow it are paid low wages (however they live in countries with a lower cost of living), and it's clearly a profitable industry at it's current pricing levels.So, the thought is to replace it with a legal, taxable industry method. I would assume that paying the growers a living wage, combined with taxes, would make the legal weed more expensive (less so in the grower states, where it will most likely be untaxed, similar to tobacco products). Why would anyone buy expensive weed, when a similar alternative exists, and the channels to do so already exist? I mean, there are definitely going to be some adopters (those who like doing things the legal way, those who don't know dealers and are too lazy to search them out, etc.). There's also the third level of competition that will most likely arise: interstate smuggling, similar to what we see with cigarettes. Individuals purchase the marijuana in untaxed states and sell it in states with the highest taxes.The other issue that comes into play is the fact that the gov't will most likely regulate the strains that can be grown commercially. So, I would think that people looking for stronger weed will, again, go outside of the taxed weed arena.Other question, and this is nothing against legalization, but more a speculative poll. Would the legalization, and possibility of a higher price for legal weed drive up the price of cartel weed? The idea being that as long as the cartel can offer a similar product for cheaper than what can be obtained legally (what the marker will bear), do people think that they will chase profits, or simply hold the status quo?

"
109951,1,"I don't think anybody is going to try and convince you that marijuana isn't habit forming, of course it is. If you're trying to allude to the idea it's ""addictive"" though, I'm going to have to disagree.It's easy to fall into a routine with any activity that provides you (near)instant gratification. Drugs are the obvious example, but countless other activities that range from the very healthy to the very unhealthy can also become habit forming to any individual that enjoys them. Drugs are generally considered to fall under the ""unhealthy"" category, but I think most people would agree that marijuana stands out as one drug that isn't all that objectively bad for you. There's no serious (immediate or long term) physical or mental harm that results from usage. Really, the worst things about marijuana for you are it's legal status and it's price.From my experience with the drug, the concept of addiction is a myth. I have tried *a lot* of different drugs, so I understand what that ""pull"" feels like when you start falling into an addiction, and I can tell you that marijuana simply doesn't mentally or physically cling to you like more serious drugs do. Sure some people have trouble eating when they stop smoking marijuana and others have trouble sleeping, but those are very mild physical problems. Real addiction requires that mental grip to keep you coming back despite all of the reasons you know you shouldn't. Lucky for us, marijuana doesn't have that mental grip. It's just an enjoyable drug that's sometimes hard to give up because you like it, not because it ""has you."" Take your cell phone as an example. Most people living in the first world, under the age of 30, are extremely attached to their phones. We take them with us everywhere we go, check them almost constantly, and positively flip out whenever we think we've lost them. Now, regardless of how much it would bother you or make you upset, wouldn't you agree that you could certainly give up your cell phone if you ever had a good enough reason to? It's understandable that you wouldn't want to, but there shouldn't be even a sliver of doubt in your mind that you could give up your phone if need be. Marijuana is the same way. You enjoy it enough that it's sometimes hard to find excuses to stop smoking it, but if/when you do, you just stop. Because you want to.Now, sharing my experience with quitting, I started smoking marijuana when I was a freshman in high school and I enjoyed the hell out of that drug for all 4 years there. However, once I started attending college and money got tight, I started meeting a lot of new people (I'm not very social when I'm high), and I became more concerned with my future, I decided to quit or at least take a good long break. And it wasn't difficult at all for me to put down the pot when I just finally sat down and thought:A) I was tired of wasting my money on it B) I was tired of my run-ins with the lawC) All of my friends were still going to be my friends whether I smoked or notD) Being sober was probably going to help me find new friendsThat was really all it took. I had the *desire* to quit and it happened, just like that. No struggle, no relapses, no complaints at all really. I firmly believe that anybody can up and quit smoking marijuana when they need to. The problem is simply that most people don't like trying to kick their habits. You know, don't blame the drug, blame the users.

112047,0,"> I'm just quoting this all because I think it's a real problem that you can ask me again for answer as if it doesn't exist, and then in the next sentence quote that precise answer.But I responded to that! You're the one not reading what I say obviously. Let me just expand on my response. True religious morality doesn't affect you harmfully, and it's much better than blindly guessing at some alternative morality. There are abuses, but you can weed them out on the basis of the Bible.What's so difficult about that to understand?> But you are the person who has repeatedly explained that they way you know your interpretation and version of God is right, is based on feelings. Not random feelings. Conscience. And CORROBORATED by the Bible. Stop twisting my words.> And yet every religion claims to deserve it. Your claims that your version of Christianity is the only obvious answer seems primarily based on your lack of understanding of other religions and unwillingness to fairly consider other viewpoints.""My version"" of Christianity is the one contained in the Bible. So that settles the denominational issues. And in terms of religion... Jesus is the only God who died for our sins. Other religions will admit as much.> This is coming from the person defending the religious wars in the Bible and slavery. You are exactly what you are preaching against.You know what I meant. Adding to or taking away from the Bible results in Catholicism, Islam... The canon is the key.> You interpret all the time, you are just denying that your interpretations in any way deviate from the plain text, just like all the other groups. The two are not the same! Of course I'm interpreting. You can't understand a text without understanding the language, the context... The important thing is that I'm not distorting it. I merely read what it says.That's a very common atheist tactic, claiming that all interpretations are equally (in)valid. Oh yeah? Well then, we can't possibly read anything. You can't read a biology book because you'd have to acknowledge the context science. Another absurd atheist claim.> So when you say ""remind"" me, you mean just dismiss whatever rights you don't agree with without explanation? We may debate whether gay marriage should be included with human rights, but you can't possibly argue it's currently one. You know what? You atheists are only shrieking in favor of gay marriage to break our backbone. You look for our faults and see nothing but hospitals and soup kitchens as far as the eye sees. So how to portray the Church of Love as hateful? Easy, start acting like gay marriage is more essential than clean water.> Yeah, thank goodness Christianity doesn't try to indoctrinate children from an early age, Teaching is not indoctrination.> involve rituals in which devotion is ritualistic affirmed ad nauseumHuh?> , and threaten doubters with eternal torture.Truth isn't a threat. Otherwise, stop threatening your children with burning for sticking their hands in flames.> They have all these things. Even the ones who don't have the Bible have their own creeds. You seem to just be repeating the assumption that your way is special, yours is right, without any support provided for that which an objective observer could judge to have merit.You keep ignoring my arguments and parroting this same old tired cliché. Yes, there are differences between religions. Yes, we can now them. First, the Bible. Second, the fruit they bear.> Yes, it says your understanding of the world is being skewed by Christian propaganda you've heard. Because that's not true. Islam is the largest religion in Asia.Islam is spreading politically. > ...sigh, I don't even know what do say here. You've no evidence for this, it's all ""Every other religion is chosen for dumb reasons, and everyone who disagrees with me doesn't get it"" with no reasoning or evidence to justify this unbridled egocentricism.I stated it shortly to save time and space. But, I can expand on every point I made. Look at the public face of Islam. Theocracies, terrorism and pressure upon Western nations to concede freedom of speech. That's not spirituality, that's political expansionism. Take Buddhism. Individuals considered ""creative"" (Steve Jobs, David Lynch) yapping about piece and happy life. No spirituality. And so on...> This is just an argument from ignorance, the same as every other religion makes. The answer is 'we don't know', not 'assume whatever you like'.That creation has a creator is not an argument from ignorance, but inductive reasoning. It's not the best form of deduction and it's prone to false statements, but it's the best we got, at least provisionally, and is by no means a fallacy. You make this exact same type of deduction every day without batting an eyelash. If I give you a painting, you'll assume someone painted it. Give you a watch, someone constructed it. Give you a baby, someone gave birth to it. Yet you happily introduce a special case, against the Occam's Razor, claiming that some arbitrary creations don't permit an assumption of a creator.> So the Bible doesn't accurately describe morality, it only describes a compromised version of morality God thought they'd follow? Because that totally demolished your claim of it being objective. It either is wrong to beat them, or it isn't.There you go again. I explained it already. Slavery was a necessary evil. There has never been a society in the world that didn't have to deprive certain persons of their freedom. So what's better? Farm work under a master's care, or a high-security prison seething with drugs and violence? Farm work or the lethal injection? Farm work or freezing to death in a cardboard box under a bridge, a quart of cheap whiskey and a shot of dirty heroine in your bulging veins?Sir, I maintain that slavery, done right, was the most moral ways of handling enemies or criminals, and that our current view of it the Unionistic propaganda from the Civil War. The Union came after the slaves to break the Confederate backbone and deprive it of its wealth, not unlike the atheists are now trying to break our backbone by screaming gay marriage.> Homosexuality I'll defend gladly and freely, as well as the right to an abortion prior to the third trimester or based on medical necessity. I never doubted it.> The rest of it is just you making random shit up based on stereotypes. There is no doctrine or creed involved in atheism that involves white supremacy, nor do you have the slightest reason to think I'd endorse it. There is no creed in atheism at all, only a description. Unlike Christianity, which has creeds.How sweet. You show your atheist, creed-less face when accused of having an agenda, and your racist Evolutionist one when needing to enforce the agenda. If atheism truly had no creed, why would you be so quick to associate yourselves with Evolutionism/Darwinism?> Who was a Christian who promoted Christianity and shut down secular education to promote the teachings of Jesus. I know this isn't the history you've been exposing yourself to, but it is history.That's a lie, pure and simple. Hitler persecuted Christians. > I've never claimed atheism as a source of perfect morality, nor communism nor totalitarians. You do claim yours is. Saying ""Aha, you don't have a perfect morality either!"" just makes my point.Actually, you explicitly claimed that atheism doesn't defend genocide. That's what I'm refuting. > Jesus got one thing right, humility is a virtue. Claiming that God agrees with everything you say and believe, because what you say and belief is what God really means, it's absurd narcissism that turns the beliefs you have as a result of geography and birth, into unquestionable biases. If you can't acknowledge that your core assumptions could be wrong and question them with the same fairness you use to question others, you can't be convinced of anything.Are you going to deny this is an ad hominem, too? Having run out of arguments, you're now trying to dismiss me as arrogant. But to do so after I've explained that I'm not only makes me think you aren't reading what I'm saying. I'll repeat it here. I'm not arrogant because I'm not claiming the truth is exclusive to me, or deserved by me. The truth is a free gift to all mankind. You're arrogant for thinking that the truth can be arrived to by your own limited senses, that it requires the education like you've got, and the books of authors you like. And how can you accuse me of arrogance when you believe your own version is correct? You think you're smarter than billions of believers, holy men, martyrs dying for Jesus. Yes, I know this is an argumentum ad populi, but I'm not using it to PROVE God - I'm pointing out your arrogance. A humble man would at least stop and think.Is my version right? Well it is. I won't apologize for the truth. It's not my fault others prefer half-truths or fantasies. The Bible and the prayer are there for everyone.I really can't go on if you're going to ignore what I say, and parrot the same tired points I thrashed three posts ago. Please acknowledge that you've read what I just said. And please, if at all possible, try to address the point of this debate: the evidence against God. It's really pointless when atheists dump all their contradicting dogma into a big pile and hope it scares the believer away. Saying ""God is immoral and doesn't exist"" is absurd.

It is not a fact.It is an opinion for everyone. Whether the War on Drugs is effective or not can be justified both ways and skewed by both sides. I personally think it is disgusting to lock someone up among real criminals for personal marijuana use. Even if you agree that they should be taught a lesson for smoking marijuana, is that lesson locking them up with murderers and other violent criminals?>Punitive prisons serve a purpose of benefit to society as a whole: they make normal citizens feel better to see criminals punished, and they provide an environment that is not an incentive to go back in. Rehabilitation as a focus does not benefit society as a whole: it only benefits the criminal.Punitive prisons don't seem to work. Our prison populations should be decreasing if they did but they are increasing. Rehabilitation does benefit society because there are less people taking up taxpayer dollars.

128685,1,"the negative effects include short term memory loss if smoked too much, especially at a younger age. and inhaling any form of smoke is inhaling carcinogens which is bad.. but you two are fighting over some of the most stupid shit. let's start with the top thing you said about it being good for people. you realize there's some people in wheelchairs that have had chronic diseases and pain with that disease that have died because they could no longer smoke marijuana to alleviate the pain. (and don't say pain pills are a good alternative. tell me that shit isn't addictive.) and if you want one basic source for that (go watch Super High Me, the movie about Doug Benson smoking every day for a month and such)... so yes it's good for some people. including me. I have depression and a decent amount of pain in my lower back and collar bone from snowboarding injuries. i don't smoke every day whatsoever, in fact i dab, which i'll get to in a minute. but if i didn't smoke every once in awhile, i'd be pissed like 99% of the time, especially because of some of my life situations. but that's just the tip of the iceberg. let's talk about the fact that mother's breast milk has cannabanoids in it, as in similar chemicals to THC, THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD. IN MOM'S BOOB MILK. and the not so obscure fact that it helps against the growth of cancerous cells in tumors.... i mean c'mon dude, our government allows tobacco with a bunch of shit in it and alcohol which people get addicted to and abuse every day, but you don't think something illegal could be good for some people? you know MDMA has been used in some soldiers coming home from Iraq and such to treat PTSD and it's had a substantial success rate.. and you asking about cleaning a bong or pipe? dude you're already smoking out of it, the smoke of plant matter. that's why i dab now. 100 times cleaner to smoke just the cannabanoids and such rather than all that. plus you vape it more anyway. and scientific research? he's right. Nixon discarded all the primary research he had done during his start of the war on drugs. if you want to read more about it take a look at the book Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, And Cheap Labor In the American Black Market by Eric Schlosser. The same guy who wrote Fast Food Nation, by the way (.ie all non fiction sources, not to mention I've done more than my fair share of reading on the topic). you're being ridiculous with the harmful thing though. no shit you don't let a pregnant woman do it or children. but it's better they try that than say alcohol or tobacco or any other narcotic. pot is by far the safest drug. also anything being over-consumed is unhealthy. long term smoking of marijuana doesn't have any side effects other than the first one i listed, if you stop smoking, your lung capacity will go back up. the end. tobacco's chemicals in the smoke are what clings to your lungs. but why do you think there's edibles, vaporizers etc now. because it's more user friendly than smoking. don't bring your drama to r/trees for no reason though. i could go on and on. but i just provided you with a bulk of information so i'll go back to reading some posts worth while.

129361,1,"> A lot of the debate revolves around legalization of marijuana (and perhaps drugs like heroin, cocaine) and how this could destroy the drug cartels source of money, thus ending their power. Perhaps, then, Central and South America would not be the most homicide-ridden, dangerous places on earth.If only it were so simple. [Sadly it isn't](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/12/why-legalizing-pot-wont-curb-the-drug-war/265729/). Then again I'm no expert. However there are two things to consider:1. What else would you legalize? Should we legalize Meth? Sex Trafficking? 2. This might sound very heartless, and once again I am not informed and am in no way able to have any legitimate opinion on this matter, but the ends shouldn't justify the means. Or rather if Marijuana is bad, then we can't say it's good to appease something else. It could be the lesser of two evils, but I think the question first is ""is it evil?"". If no, then let's legalize already, and if yes, then let's take action in that direction.As for the rest of your post, I'm so glad you are so involved and concerned about this. There is a lot of evil and injustice going on in the world right now. As we speak Christians are being slaughtered in Africa, Syria, and persecuted in China. Thousands of women and children are sold into slavery. Millions are dying from malnutrition and disease in less developed countries. Millions more are being killed in the womb by the people they should be trusting the most.This shouldn't be cause for despair, but for activism. Get involved. You'd be surprised how much one organization, no matter how small, can do. And most importantly Pray. It's the only way to combat the real evils which are the root of all this. You mentioned trying to reach out to such evil people... Well it would take an amazing and supernatural grace to do so. Unlike what the top post of /r/atheism said today, prayer is the BEST thing you could do for any situation. This of course doesn't mean saying ""God help them"" and looking away.I hope this helped.

The aftermath being that businesses are forced out of SF, people who can do so opt to move elsewhere taking their money away from the city's small businesses, the city gets becomes a haven of extreme rich and poverty, and ultimately bursts the current housing bubble sending property values tumbling. At that point, when the city has been taken down a few pegs, it would be the opportune time for those who financed the seeds of unrest to swoop in, buy up cheap property, and invest by offering private solutions to fix the city's problems thus making boatloads of money and stealthily conquer a city in about two decades.It's regressive Imperialism disguised as progressive and the affluent families will once again become the kings of the world and fight over it's throne like a game.Okay, that's a little extreme but I'd like to write the screenplay, get Clooney to be the plant, and have GRRM write the characters and sex scenes.

Note also that while I am speaking generally about ""acts,"" it actual issue relates to the charges. edit. For example, adopting your example above. If a person was convicted for marijauan and Congress made weed legal and retroactively applied it retroactively, the person would go free. Conversly, if the person was convicted for the fight (but not the weed), and Congress still retoactively made weed legal, the person would stay in prison.

141336,1,"You hear about bar fights involving drunk people, but not cafe fights involving people hopped up on coffee. This seems like a ridiculous example, but if you really believe drugs are dangerous *not because of their physical properties but because* ***they're accepted***, it is worth using.I don't feel like writing a *ton* right now, but here goes:There's no beating around the bush; alcohol and cigarettes are terribly damaging. More so than marijuana. But they are undoubtedly 'dangerous' because of their nature as drugs. Let's start with booze. For one, prohibition in the United States [made things even worse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States#Effects_of_the_Prohibition). The chemical itself is what makes you bad at almost everything, intensifies emotion, and retards decision-making skills. Usually this just manifests in social problems, but if you're prone to aggression, alcohol can take away what control you have over it. And of course, there's drunk driving. In the U.S., where I live now, you'll get in trouble if you're caught stumbling home drunk. Here, drunk driving accidents [cause 40% of all traffic-related deaths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_driving_in_the_United_States). In the Netherlands, where I used to live, it is acceptable to safely walk your drunk ass home, and [""25% of severely injured drivers that had ended up in hospital, had alcohol in their blood""](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/knowledge/alcohol/prevalence_amp_rate_of_alcohol_consumption/crashes_and_injuries.htm) (nearest statistical comparison I could make in a pinch). Just using this as another quick attack on the argument that social acceptance is what causes harm by drugs.And it's funny, about the Netherlands. You may know that marijuana is more-or-less legal there. But as it turns out, the United States has the [highest reported rate of adults who have used cannabis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_lifetime_cannabis_use_by_country). The highest rate *in the world*, at 51.6%! In the Netherlands -- I repeat, in the Netherlands, where I can legally purchase marijuana *at a marijuana store*, fewer than half as many adults (21.5%) have ever used cannabis. It seems decriminalizing/legalizing marijuana *doesn't even increase its use!!*Cigarettes aren't very psychoactive, at least not in the same ways as marijuana or alcohol. Nicotine is highly addictive -- [on par with cocaine, apparently](http://liquorstorebear.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/drug-harm-chart-from-lancet.png) -- sorry, no better source for the chart, which used to be somewhere on wp. Smoking is so obviously harmful I'm not going to go on about *how*. I think it suffices to say you'll never find a doctor who would answer ""why is smoking bad for you"" with anything like ""because it is legal and socially accepted"".Certainly, making cigarettes illegal would reduce the number of smokers and the frequency at which a lot of them smoke. It would almost definitely improve public health. It's not my call where to draw the line between heroin (which is not hard to overdose on) and cigarettes (which are undoubtedly death-engendering, but take decades to kill you). But illegalizing tobacco would also create a black market.I'm not going to take the time to argue in favor of legalization of marijuana just now. I am only attacking the view that social acceptance and legality are what makes drugs dangerous. Haven't you heard about a lot of cocaine/crack/meth/heroin overdoses before? They are illegal and socially much less acceptable than marijuana, so given your belief, one would expect marijuana-related deaths to be more common. I can't recall ever hearing about one.The fact is, these other drugs are more harmful than marijuana because of how they chemically interact with our bodies. Weed may be carcinogenic, but you'd have a hard time smoking a dozen joints every day for the rest of your life (as one might with cigarettes). Outwardly, pot makes you drowsy, prone to distraction, and physically incompetent. No matter who smokes it, nor how much, nor how okay everyone is with it, I imagine the worst things marijuana could lead to are along the lines of falling asleep at the wheel. The nice thing is, when you're really stoned, you're lucky if you can manage to stand up, much less hurt yourself.I hope I covered enough. Done for now, because of course, I want a cigarette.

143394,1,"it just makes so much sense to legalize marijuana. for instance, instead of spending x dollars (and thus increasing the deficit by x dollars) on the so called war on marijuana, pot could be legalized and taxes levied through its sale. so, instead of spending x dollars (on officers and jails), the federal government could be making x dollars (that could then be used to fix a crumbling educational system and control skyrocketing healthcare costs). instead of losing x dollars, the government is making x dollars. it's like a 4 point swing in basketball. let's not forget the changes in the murder rate (in the us and mexico) and safety in mexico (immigration too?) i just wish constituents and lawmakers weren't this dumb and that lobbies (prison guard unions, pharmaceutical companies in this case) weren't controlling this beautiful country.

157660,1,"Because doctors lobbied to get that designation. If an illegal drug has a powerful lobby then you'll see their schedule I classification be dropped. Marijuana will be the first to fall nationally in the form of a prescribed medication (since the medical community and patients will lobby for it). From there, low amounts will be decriminalized (due to community groups arguing that there are no/limited negative effects in patient populations). And eventually, similar to alcohol, larger amounts would be decriminalized as the stigma against marijuana fades from existence.And, based on the literature, I bet the hallucinogens would follow marijuana's pattern soon thereafter.

Please note that the ""officers"" in the picture are actually capitol security, mostly concerned with the flowers. The Madison police made no attempt to establish a presence at this rally for the legalization of marijuana.

173299,0,">He is not cheating.It's not really a question of whether the other guy is cheating. This is simply a matter of sucking the fun out of the game. If a guy TR's a dude for his best player, giving up crap in return, good for that guy. But if a team becomes absolutely unstoppable, because someone is stupid, that takes the fun away for me, personally. Almost like Jacksonville fans right now. Why even watch the game, Sunday? The ""Fantasy Dream Team"" is playing them. It's almost not even fair. Sure, Denver *signed* all of those players, and everything was done within the rulebook. No one is saying Denver is cheating by having that ridiculous offense, but it's not going to be an entertaining game at *all* to watch. The difference being, I paid money to be in the fantasy league. I don't have financial investment in the betterment of the Jaguars.I don't like having to forfeit my money just because someone else was a moron. Vetoes being abolished would change the game, in my opinion, for the worst. Should the ""four vote"" thing be the ""default"" veto? No. But should vetoes be a thing of the past? Absolutely not.First, you need to be in a league with a commissioner whose judgment you trust, and who will listen to the league members cases before making a ruling.In my league, the four-vote ""veto"" is currently in place. But the twist is, once the four votes are accumulated, the trade is in limbo, and goes to a group chat. The commissioner and anyone who wants to debate the validity of the trade just hash it out with words. This year, a guy traded Steven Jackson (*after* his injury) and Lamar Miller for Jamaal Charles and Eddie Lacy (right after his concussion, so he was still injured). This got voted off for debate, because even at 100%, Jackson isn't close to Charles' level. But we debated it, and we were dealing with a guy who thought Lacy would turn out well, and he happened to be a gigantic Falcons fan. So, he was happy bringing in those guys. It ended up being pushed through and processed, even though many of us weren't comfortable with it, but what are you gonna do?The fact is, without any sort of veto process whatsoever, there couldn't have even been a talk. And that could just be damaging. The threat of ""get too crazy and this isn't going to happen"" has to be there, or you'll introduce collusion. What would stop me from talking to my friend and saying ""Give me your two starting WRs, I'll give you my 3rd RB and 3rd WR, and we'll split the pot at the end of the year?"" Sure, it's collusion, but no one would be able to prove it if they didn't hear us talking, and didn't see me hand him money. Vetoes are essential, if nothing else, in minimal fashion.**EDIT:** sorry, just realized how much I typed, here. **TL;DR:** Without a veto in some form, money leagues can implode

174393,1,"Actually hemp can be used to ruin illegal marijuana grows when you're growing marijuana you only want to keep the female plants the males are useless for smoking and will cause the female plants to produce seeds which lowers the potency and makes the weed unpleasant to smoke so the male hemp plants will cross pollinate the female marijuana plants

184310,1,"Only if we change our production patterns. The cultivation of industrial hemp is only legal in a few US states (California just legalized it recently) and is complicated by intense regulation. The cultivation of recreational marijuana, large scale, has similar issues. If the US were to regulate marijuana instead of prohibiting it, it will still probably take a long time for farms, let alone dispensaries to set up (look at Washington state, Connecticut, Rhode Island for example).Thus the cartels could probably survive long enough on their current business model to make laundered investment inroads in the new legal industry. If no strong regulations are put in place to deter big corporations from buying up the market, you end up with Big Tobacco buying everyone out and spraying pesticides on everything. A small minority of ""organic"" farmers would sell at higher prices to the wealthy until they found their fields cross pollinated and contaminated chemically in a decade or two.The reality of cannabis legalization is pretty complicated imo

203767,1,"to you and /u/carefoot cannabis can *prevent* cancer, not *cure* it. we should give weed to cancer patients in order to ease their pain, but if it was as easy as giving them cannabis to cure cancer i can assure you it wouldn't be as big of a problem as it is now. i am in favor of more lax legislation but what irks me the most is people that talk about it as their ""medication"" and use it basically to get high when other people who should be given access to it because of their health issues can't use it because of stupid and dated laws. don't think i'm some weed hater people, just trying to add my grain of salt to the situation.

207337,1,"Lived in Barcelona for almost a year. I was a member of a cannabis association which meant that after I was referred to one by a member I could join. Since when I moved there I didn't know anyone I actually just walked in and said I liked to smoke and wanted to join. They contacted me a week later saying I was in. I paid 10 EUR for a year membership and I could go to this shop (all blacked out windows and had a bouncer at the door) where I could look through all the different buds and smoke in there. You could also take the weed with you. Good bud, not as good as Holland but definitely high end stuff. People are really lax about bud there, I always smelled it at the beach and the occasional people walking around. From my understanding, when it comes to personal amounts its only illegal to be using in public. It tends to be Pakistani guys selling the drugs on the streets. The street coke I came across with was horrible but I did get bomb MDMA off a guy I met through the street. He hooked me up though because I was always going to the same club and I'd give him cigarettes and shoot the shit with him when I was shitfaced after. They also sell a lot of crystal but that isnt my thing so idk if it was any good. Didn't come across any type of prescriptions. Ketamine was pretty popular and I met a few connects with it who I bought from. I went out alone most weekends and I'm a pretty social guy/my Spanish is pretty good so I always struck up conversations with locals. Once they realized I wasn't just some random American that expected everyone to speak Spanish (there are a lot of those people) we'd always hit it off. The coke I got offered was usually pretty good quality. The culture there is awesome. People are really cool. They're big into their hash there too. Lots of drug sharing, lots of random people that will come up to you looking to sell you shit if they think you're a tourist. Got ripped off a couple of times but whatever, 90% of the time it was straight. Only ever saw one guy get busted by some plainclothes officers at a music festival (piknik electronik this summer) who was rolling hash into a cig. But I think they just took it off him. The cops are more likely to fuck with you if you are selling or being a drunken asshole than if you're burning. Also do *NOT* underestimate the pickpockets. The Pakistani/Indian guys who are selling beers/waters outside of clubs stay sober the whole night. So especially at the clubs near the beach where everyone goes at 6AM to finish the night they are always trying to see how fucked up people are to judge whether they can steal a handbag or something. They're quick and work in teams. One time I had been rolling but I guess they thought I was drunk because one of them stuck their hand in a girls purse I was talking to and I pushed him over and he ran off. It's a fucking blast mate, don't bring out i.d. (you won't need it), and I always only brought out cash and kept enough for a taxi in my apartment just in case I lost everything. Way harder to replace a card than it is cash. If you have any other questions please feel free to message me, my time there was the best time of my life. And learning some Spanish will really help you, even if its just to show an effort.

And therefore if a plant was breeded with lets say 0.2% of THC and 18% CBD, wouldn't you be able to sell it worldwide as a medicine without encountering any problems with the law?

217059,1,"Me and my girlfriend (before she was my girlfriend and I was just the guy she fucked on the side) were sitting in her car one night in the parking lot of a stadium our city had shut down after building a new one. It was pitch black out there and we parked in a corner like we usually do because it's off an expressway and nobody can see shit. We smoked a fat bowl of dank and, as usual, one thing lead to another and she starts blowing me. About 2 minutes into it, I see headlights in the rearview. I instantly know it is cops (I've gotten pretty good at identifying headlights) so of course, my reaction is ""oh shit, that's cops behind us"". She gets up just in time for one of the officers to walk up to the window which is slightly rolled down. He knocks on the window and says ""smoke weed much?"". Obviously he can smell it. I stuff my dick back in my pants and start to internally panic. I know he's going to find the bowl, there's no hiding that, but there's about 2 grams sitting in a bag in the little door handle crevice of the door. (Her car has the handle cut out of the armrest of the door, like [this](https://www.redlinegoods.com/images/MiataDoor-05.jpg)) As she is getting out of the car, I slyly reach up and grab it, and shove it into the pocket of the shorts I was wearing under my jeans. We get out, do the standard questioning and give them our ID's. They find the bowl and then start patting us down. They run our ID's and come back and give us a lecture about how they could take us to jail right now. She starts the waterworks (which I later found out was fake) and begs them not to. They tell us they are going to make a report, but that they're not going to arrest us. They tell us we MIGHT get summoned to a court date and take the pipe. They give us back our ID's and tell us to go on our way. We immediately go to the gas station, get a rello, and go park in her apartment parking lot. We smoked the rest of the bag in a fat blunt and she finished giving me head. She took me home and we never heard anything else about the incident again. Never been that close to shitting my pants in my life.TL;DR -- Got caught getting my dick sucked after smoking dank in a parking lot. Took the bowl, didn't find the rest of the weed in my pocket. Smoked the rest somewhere else and finished getting my dick sucked.
