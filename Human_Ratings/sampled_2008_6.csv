213,1,"A big reason why Marijuana continues to be illegal is that us smokers live up to the stereotype of apathy that society has given us. Almost 10% of Americans smoke habitually - that is by far enough people to create an influential lobby in Washington. Farmers make up 3% of the population, and the farm lobby is one of the most powerful in Washington.We all want Marijuana to be legal, but where's the monetary support? For the price of ONE slice - one 1/8 - if we donated to NORML or a similar organization than it would be enough to influence change. But no - instead we'll just sit on our ass and post a reddit story saying ""vote up if you think marijuana should be legalized"" How many people who voted up actually donated to make their voices heard? This is the ONLY way that this will happen.So don't pick up this week, put the bong down and make a contribution.http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=7191

304,1,"I love how his biggest arguments against decriminalization are the fact that MJ cases aren't burdening the courts and that officers don't carry scales......wtf? So with that logic, we should keep pissing on peoples' faces illegal simply because the cases don't currently overburden the courts, and officers don't carry urine tests, forgetting about the other reasons why it's illegal. If you're trying to come up with some bullshit reason why weed needs to be illegal (which it doesn't, for the record), try not pulling something out of your ass.

Of course I would bet you are right because it was probably meant for a select audience that I was not in. If you remember thats how the tubes became a spoiler in the 04 election for some campaigns because no longer could they say bigoted or stupid things to select audiences and keep it quiet. Of course I dont think that would have been a stupid thing to say but he was a very conservative dem. Carter is the only one I remember saying it even in primaries going back to the 80's though. Every once in a while you would get a Kucinich but never a realistic candidate that the public would accept for some reason. I do on the other hand remember Clinton saying we should look more into the science which many took as code for possible legalization until they realized he whispered it and did not mean it. Not to mention if he would have whispered it to loud the repubs would have been all over the ""stoner"" president since he was never forgiven for smoking pot even though we were not supposed to discuss Bush's coke habit at the same time period.

632,1,"I was too simplistic... I think Scalia likes the judicial system so whenever it comes to Guantanamo and the Bush admin trying to compete with the civil judicial system, Scalia gets a bit testy. Other than that, take a look at Scalia's ruling in the medical marijuana case, he cited the commerce clause whereas before he was totally against it. So to me Scalia has some strong political persuasions that are more relevant than his talk about ""state's rights"". In any case, Thomas does march to the beat of his own drummer, and I kinda like that in him, you can't really predict where he will go but he does tend to favor Bush in many instances. Re: signing statements, it seems that Alito was big on promoting signing statements while he worked under Reagan. And recent supreme court cases had Alito, Roberts, Scalia and Thomas all supporting the concept of signing statements. I haven't studied law, but it is damn interesting. I admire that you actually had/have a course on this subject.

635,1,"Private_Freedom: You know, the first few posts I read from you made me think you were just an abrasive jerk playing the same record over and over. But, I'll admit I was wrong, for the most part :).I also see that you've clarified one of your stances against Sen. Obama to be more accurate; Vote in favor of a bill that **contained** REAL ID. Much more clear and accurate. Thank you for that.While I don't agree with the black/white veracity of some of your points here (Such as the REAL ID vote), I respect your opinion and support of Dr. Paul. I would like to point out that Sen. Obama has clarified his stance on decriminalizing marijuana recently, and while I'll agree it looks a lot like a flip-flop, I honestly think it was just a bit of a mis-understanding and an effort to clarify his stance:Jan 31, 2008 [link](http://reason.com/blog/show/124727.html); Basic gist: ""The Washington Times reports that Barack Obama, who told an audience of college students when he was running for the U.S. Senate in 2004 that he favored decriminalizing marijuana, still holds that position, although he opposes complete legalization. According to his campaign, Obama mistakenly raised his hand during a presidential debate last fall when the candidates were asked which of them opposed marijuana decriminalization.""So, it isn't quite just ""illegal going to jail forever!"" vs. ""smoke it if you got it!"". I think it is a step in the right direction that sets precedent to move forward another step in the future. Make possession a minor offense (one that likely will rarely be fined, especially for small personal amounts), eliminate the ""criminal"" and mandatory minimums, and pave the way for states to further relax the rules. The next step could be the ability to legally possess small amounts.It is certainly a better road than Clinton or McCain; and yes I agree that Ron Paul's stance is the better, but he has pretty much given up the presidential run to focus on his congressional run (and I hope he gets a ton of support).

Under the pseudonym ""Mr. X"", he wrote an essay concerning cannabis smoking in the 1971 book Marihuana Reconsidered, whose editor was Sagan's close friend, Lester Grinspoon.[19][20] In his essay, Sagan wrote how marijuana use had helped to inspire some of his works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences. After Sagan's death, Grinspoon disclosed this to Sagan's biographer, Keay Davidson. The publishing of this biography, Carl Sagan: A Life, in 1999, brought much media attention to the issue of the use and legalization of marijuana.[21] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan

The largest of these are maintained by drug gangs. Who don't care about posted no gun laws. Metro parks in my city, popular jogging, biking, and general recreation activities, have been recently plagued by a series of rape attempts, and have always been a prime place for muggings, despite regular police patrols on bike and in cruiser.

You complain about noise from your neighbor's party, or ask them to mow their lawn because it's starting to look overgrown, suddenly they decide to inform the police that you're growing marijuana and distributing it.The police get a warrant, knock down your door, tear apart your home, and apologize when they don't find anything.

1815,1,"April 17, 2008To: Faculty and StaffFr: Executive Vice Chancellor David KligerRe: ""4-20"" ActivityApril 20th (4-20) has become known nationwide as the date when people gather to communally smoke marijuana in an expression of support for the reform of marijuana laws. In recent years, thousands of people have gathered on the UCSC campus to participate in this event.The University does not condone, support or otherwise sanction this event. The increasingly large crowds that have gathered in recent years present safety risks for participants, whether students or people not affiliated with the campus. This activity also violates a number of campus regulations designed to provide for the well-being of our campus and neighboring community.In anticipation of this year's April 20 activity, I have authorized the implementation of a number of restrictions for this coming weekend, April 19-20. This communication is intended to alert the community of the transportation changes, parking restrictions, and other actions that will limit access to campus.This advance notification is provided to enable those who have valid reasons for coming to campus this weekend to adjust their schedules and transportation plans accordingly:o The West Entrance to campus will be closed to inbound vehicular traffic on Sunday.o The Main Entrance will be open that day, but campus personnel will restrict vehicular access to people who have UCSC parking permits or who can show evidence they are attending sanctioned campus events that day.o Parking permits will be required in all campus lots throughout the weekend, even in those that typically require no permits on weekends. The parking restriction will include evening hours on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. (If you need to park on campus this weekend and do not currently have a permit, you will need to purchase one by 6 p.m. on Friday.)o At our request Metro bus drivers will not bring riders onto campus on Sunday. The only ""campus"" stop, coming to and from UCSC, will be the one adjacent to the Main Entrance on Empire Grade. (If disability transportation is needed as a result of this restriction, special van service on campus can be requested at this one bus stop.)o There will be no on-campus shuttle service during the day on Sunday.o Empire Grade will be designated as a tow-away zone, and vehicles that illegally park on Empire Grade during the weekend will be ticketed and may be towed at the owners' expense. Extra patrols will be on duty to enforce these restrictions.o Drivers and passengers who can't prove that they have a legitimate reason to be on campus on Sunday will be turned away at the main gate. People can anticipate that there will be delays at the Main Entrance's kiosk.Please remember that all UCSC students, staff and their guests are expected to comply with University policy and federal and state law.

1902,1,"*The issue with pot is that if you go through a drug dealer, the chances are that he sells other drugs which he can sell for a greater profit... like cocaine, crack or heroin...etc.*First of all, the ""gateway drug"" fallacy has been [debunked](http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Health/2006/12/04/marijuana_not_gateway_drug_after_all/2823/) for a while now. Second, the above statement seems to argue in favor of decriminalization, since users would have a great many more dependable alternatives for supply than the drug dealer (whose trade, by definition, relies upon the drug remaining illegal).*I'm not trying to advocate going out and getting hammered, it's generally a bad idea...but drinking doesn't kill people, making stupid choices kills people.*Alcohol causes *far* more harm than mere driving under the influence. Wrapping your car around a tree is just one of the many, many ways an alcoholic can self-destruct, and some damage is simultaneously less visible and more terrible than that.
"
2149,1,"I agree. To be honest, I'm not sure what my answer is, so I'm just playing devil's advocate in trying to reason things out.I think my problem is with drug culture itself. It's not something that I would like to see encouraged. Although, I admit, that's not really a reason to make something illegal. I think what should happen is that we pragmatically legalize it, like tobacco. You can smoke, just not indoors. This is viewed as dictatorship by most smokers, but in my opinion it's an attempt to provide a balance between the rights of smokers and non-smokers. And on the issue of drugs, this same approach would keep anti-drug-use people like me happy because it could keep it away from me and my family, and it keeps the drug-heads happy cause they can get quality controlled substances from potentially the newsagent. You know this is never going to happen right, because people who don't do drugs fear them and will never give any leeway. My argument is with the proponents of drug-culture. As somebody who has first hand experience of the destructive powers of the pot smoking lifestyle, and witness to many people losing grip on life through becoming dependent upon the weed I get irritated by people who seem to think that it's harmless just because nobody has OD'd on it!hmmm....

2299,1,"Doesn't mean that your pot doesn't *affect* interstate commerce.If one person buys it and goes across state lines, the fed can have a say. Even if pot purchases cause more people to buy chips and salsa, that might cause a change in distribution patterns for grocery stores using trucks that cross state lines.Check the case law on the commerce clause. It doesn't work *every* time, but it has been used to give the fed some amazingly long reach.

"
2634,1,"Of course, that also works if you simply replace ""cannabis"" with ""alcohol"", and set it during the prohibition era.That doesn't make ""alcohol"" dangerous - it makes the *kind of people who traffic in it in bulk while it's illegal* dangerous.Legalise/decriminalise it and every point you raise simply disappears. This should demonstrate clearly that *even by your odd definition* the danger is not the drug, but its illegal status, no?
"
2687,1,"> no, I've run out of the time I allotted for pointless argument.Fair play. Then say that instead and I have a lot more respect for your position. ;-)Taking your points one by one:> pot will get you high and it is a drug/controlled substance/whateverTrue, it is widely considered a ""drug"". However, there's no good definition as to what constitutes ""a drug"" and what doesn't. Drugs are basically defined as ""things we call drugs"" and non-drugs are defined as ""things we don't call drugs"" - there's little or no correlation between the word ""drug"" and a substance's dangerousness, legality or psychoactivity.Therefore, when we're debating how dangerous a substance is, the fact that it's ""a drug"" means nothing... so ""it's a drug"" is not a valid argument when discussing its dangerousness or legality.> pot is addictive both mentally and physicallyThere is [no evidence](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/mar/15/drugsandalcohol.medicalscience) whatsoever that pot is physically addictive. However, I will back down from my claim it's *definitely* 100% non-addictive, since in my quick research now I can't find any studies making that explicit claim (unsurprising, given how hard it is to prove a negative).Nevertheless, studies repeatedly demonstrate that it is highly unlikely that it's physiologically addictive (or that any such effect is so negligibly tiny it's almost impossible to observe), and it's almost universally acknowledged to be less addictive, toxic or dangerous than many legal drugs.Compare this to most other illegal drugs - and legal ones such as nicotine and alcohol - where physiological addictiveness has long been established beyond a shadow of a doubt.It *is* mentally addictive to some degree, but then so are many other substances which are *much* more harmful (try looking up the toxicity of caffeine some time, or nicotine).Thus the fact it's mildly (psychologically) addictive is clearly not a good reason to castigate or ban it, when it's already considered harmless and appropriate for people to run much greater risks with shopping, sex, chocolate, gambling and many other legal activities.> who cares whether or not THC by itself is addictive -- you could argue the same for cigarettes not being addictiveExcept that the point of smoking cannabis is to get the THC, and any tobacco you smoke with it is purely optional (use bongs or vaporisers if you want to avoid tobacco). In contrast, the nicotine in a cigarette is both the addictive constituent *and* is the main point of smoking it.Cannabis (THC) is not conventionally thought to be addictive - the fact you *can* (but don't have to) mix it with addictive substances doesn't make it dangerous, in the same way water isn't dangerous simply because you *can* mix it with bleach.> the culture behind pot is that of drug dealers & addicts, not the same as that of the culture behind casual drinkingObviously I can't speak for all cannabis-smokers everywhere... but certainly in the UK, in the majority of cases I've ever come across, it's much more usual for cannabis to percolate through friendship (and friend-of-friend) networks than it is for a group of disparate individuals to go to a ""dealer"" whom they don't otherwise know.Either way, this is again a case of cannabis's legal state causing danger, not cannabis the substance.> pot comes from drug lords who kill people and it is not a harmless happy rainbow utopia drug[Citation needed]Traditionally organised gangs deal in things like coke and heroin, which is much smaller, more easily smuggled and offers much higher returns on investment.And FWIW, *nobody's* seriously suggesting cannabis is a ""happy rainbow utopia drug"", any more than you're seriously suggesting it's cynically grown by commie terrorists bent on perverting and destroying the youth of the West. See, aren't straw-men fun?> pot can cause you to swerve your car into a little kid on a tricycle, no matter how stupid that seemsSo can alcohol, sleepiness, a bee in the car, or momentarily losing concentration because you think you recognise someone.You're *really stretching* for dangers now. Do we now classify as ""dangerous"" bees and recognisable people, too?

Is that at all suspicious ?, My father have Tehelka subscribed so i get to read it. If you want i will scan the magazine page by page and will let you count how many Government Ministry and Political Party's advertisements are there. And do you know all those people who were interviewed were not party of VHP / BJP / RSS, most of them were waiting for judgements in their case. Tehelka's undercover agent came up to then and said that they are writing a book and interviewed for that. How stupid do you think those people are ? Fact is, it is people like you who are fool to fall for that Congress Party and Tehelka propaganda. What actually happened was that those people's families were provided money for those statements. Think on your own, these guys were waiting to spend rest of their life on jail, now Congress party provided their family some money for those statements which wont affect them.

But why Modi ? Because he have won many elections in a row already, His state is having biggest share of India's GDP, receives most FDI and is most progressive. Congress is scared of what Modi have done against all odds. When riots broke out, Media and Congress party brainwashed me to start to hate Modi and Gujarat. But today now that I know how me and many more have been fooled, I will vote for him even though I am not domiciled in his state. My wish is that he should become our PM.

3662,1,"I can clearly recall telling my friends, ""Society will have to wake up soon enough and legalize pot!"" Unfortunately, that was in 1969. It has taken over forty years to get to the point where politicians aren't afraid to even raise the issue of decriminalization. I guess that can be considered a victory, however meager. Until marijuana is completely legalized though, we are still enslaved by that same old evil oligarchy whose laws are predicated upon religious dogma, their social norms dictated by an hysterical distrust of ""the other"". I have an acquaitance who is a great guy, but he's not ""all there"", if you know what I mean. This dude has been busted twice for simply loving mother nature, as far as I'm concerned. He's good at nothing but growing (to which I could happily attest:), but after losing eleven years in prison to that modern witch-hunt known as ""the War on Drugs"", he can't be seen anywhere near the stuff. What a shame. So, here's to Barney Frank and all those who labor in the fields (so to speak:). May we some day be free, with my acquaintance happily doing what Nature intended him to do, for the benefit and happiness of us all.

3766,1,"lol so true, i think that our country is much more lenient on 'crimes' related to pot, and for <30g of pot it's now only worth a fine, no criminal record or jail time
"
3865,1,"Perhaps not, but the difference is that murder actually has a victim.You bring up a good point. It is a false argument to say that we should legalize pot because it isn't stopping people from using it. We need to question the need to try to stop people in the first place. It isn't like murder at all.

"
4919,1,"I realized the government was evil, and thus realized why pot is illegal.
"
4962,1,"Yeah? So? What?I get so sick and tired of people promoting cannabis as it ""does less harm"". It's the wrong defense. How about my defense to put in my body what I damned well please without have stones thrown at me by the government, insurance companies, my work place, or society? Everyone has their vices, except maybe a handful of strict nuns and Buddhist monks.When we frame the debate on it's legalization on ""well it's less harmful than the current legal things"", you're basically giving incentive to be more strict with the legal substances, not more liberating with the illegal ones.Now if you were arguing that they should remain illegal, but have a sane federal re-classification of the drugs based on harm, then fine, solid argument.But pot does have medical consequences and can create negative effects. I don't think people should get high and drive anymore than i think they should drive drunk. Pot has a tendency with habitual use make one lazy, though some are not part of that stereotype. A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, and depression. Another study has found that an abuser’s risk of heart attack can more than quadruples in the first hour after smoking marijuana. The researchers suggest that such an outcome might occur from marijuana’s effects on blood pressure and heart rate (it increases both) and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.And you can compare it's negative effects on the lungs to be similar as all natural (hand picked and smoked) tobacco. (note; there's a grave difference between smoking natural tobacco and Phillip Morris's crap with elevated levels of various carcinogen's and nicotine.)Is pot any where as near as bad corporate pushed tobacco? Or alcohol? No. But the shape of the whole argument seems to pit various substance users against others, when there's an underlying fundamental right we all share, that should be the point of debate.It's quite simple. Our body, our right. The end. If legalized, the only additional rights we have is to be informed what we're putting into our bodies. Something we currently don't have with much of our food, beverages, and tobacco as it stands. Beyond that, let people do with their bodies and their property as the deem fit.

5151,1,"blackrobot, that is just ridiculous. ""Defender of capitalism."" I take major exception to that! Arresting people for entering the market of cannabis, is not defending capitalism. That is arresting it. Infringing on property rights is not defending capitalism. (Unwarranted searches/seizures of vendors and skateboarders). It is starkly the opposite. And you know what? You pay for that discrimination with your (or your parents pay for it) own hard earned tax dollars. That is the communist system. Police state. Deep seeded with corruption and discrimination. Don't get me wrong though. I am not saying all cops are the scum of the earth. I am merely talking about the system within which they operate. A system that justifies executor bureaucrats using violence on the people they protect will only naturally give birth to problems like corruption and racism. It is not a system based in capitalism, contractual law, natural rights, or even liberty. It is one based in control. Something central planners (communists) require in order to carry out their plans.

If he says, ""I smelled weed,"" or ""he was driving erratically"", or any number of things, it could and probably would be seen as the cop's judgment call, i.e., even if there was no weed, the cop could have thought he smelled it, which would be probable cause. And if there was nothing illegal found, I would guess that a judge would take a ""no harm no foul"" attitude and not ruin the cop's career over it.

5246,1,"Attorneys are *supposed* to zealously represent their clients. If you can't pay for a good one, you're *supposed* to get a public defender who represents your interests. This isn't how things always work, or probably even how things mostly work.That said, I have a few friends that could make lots of money at a firm and instead chose to be public defenders, because that was their calling. In fact, it's stories like this one that probably drove those people to being public defenders in the first place.So sure, maybe a bad public defender with almost no time per client was representing this kid. But I spent about 5 minutes on westlaw and already found one case that made the whole 'metabolite' thing sound pretty shaky. If a jury rejects that, then they wouldn't necessarily find intent in the accident because they wouldn't find that the kid was under the influence. Then feticide is most likely out the window entirely. And the charge for the other two gets dropped significantly. And all it takes is one holdout on the jury, one person who smoked pot at some point or just knew people who did, and knew that it was crazy to destroy a kid's life on the argument that he was still affected by pot weeks later. Just one person is all it takes, and there would probably be lots of people with that experience on the jury.So if they went to trial the kid could have gotten off a lot lighter. And I think a public defender could have handled this case pretty well: admit the accident happened negligently or recklessly but not knowingly or intentionally, and play up the age of the kid and the stupid argument of the prosecution.How much would it cost? The depends on a lot. Like how much time was spent in preparation and filing motions. How long the trial lasted. That sort of thing. Lots of lawyers, if they took a case like this, would recognize the limited resources of the family and consider that when coming up with a bill. I don't think the cost would be as bad as you're thinking, probably.

What about state-sanctioned eugenics programs? Cosmetic surgery for pre-teens? Clitorodectomies? Should doctors be forced to perform any procedure that happens to be legal at a given place and time? I support the right of people to freedom to practice within the health profession without violating *their* religious beliefs - even when they conflict with *my* beliefs. You cannot regulate or force a Catholic hospital to provide services that the Pope tells them are sinful - they will simply close, or continue to provide their usual services in defiance of legislation. As I said, where I live, about a third of medical services are offered by religious communities. These places would close before violating their ethics. That would put enormous pressure on the public health system and the non-religious private health system. If I want birth control, I'm not going to go to a Catholic hospital. If I go to a pharmacy and they don't stock what I want, I'm not going to tell them they have to order it in because I have a right to it. >Its the same as a vegetarian getting a job at KFC and having the right to not serve or cook the food ... it's more like going to KFC and ordering veal, or going to a kosher restaurant and ordering pork. Aside from which, the food industry is hardly dependant on vegetarians, whereas the health industry is largely dependant on religious people. The concept that the state should have power to impose its ethics onto people with no regard for common religious beliefs is an absurd one, fraught with dangers. It is a de facto exclusion of major religious groups from the field of health care. If I own a pharmacy and I want to provide birth control, I'm not going to hire someone who has an ethical problem with selling it. Where the state provides the health services, they can hire people who are ethically happy to do the job they require. But while religious hospitals and pharmaceutical proprietors are around, they should have the right to operate within the bounds of their ethics.

Under the EPA, a company that finds it more convenient to simply pollute if it costs more to clean up their act, than to pay the fines, will do so. My father, for example, worked for a company that openly did this for several decades. The EPA also has been manipulated and rigged by the same agencies that would see CO2 emissions classified a pollutant -- a purely political move if ever I saw one. The EPA itself was formed from a conglomeration of other entities *at corporate parties' request* in order to expedite their exploitation of the environment under the name of ""fulfilling environmental regulations"" -- the sort of behavior that could not be underwent if the environmentalist public knew that they had to watch out for such things on their own. As to the FDA -- that's an even worse joke. I mean, seriously now: marijuana is a worse drug than heroin, opium, or methaamphetamines? On what planet?But even then... the FDA came into existence in a time before ubiquitous communication and information, when medicine itself was still in a very poor state. And as it stands today the FDA is the **very epitome** of fascism in the US. It started out that way, and it remains the tool of corporate interests to exclude new movers in the market. And, once again, isn't it awfully interesting that those parties already existed by the time the FDA came into existence? Almost as though someone with a good deal of money *wanted* it to happen, so as to protect his ability to line *his* pockets?> Not naive, true.

I go back to what I've always said about drug use. The problem is NOT the drugs, the problem is PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. Alcohol is legal (if you are of age). Many people enjoy alcohol responsibly. Many others make wrong choices or cannot handle it responsibly. The problem is not the individuals ""drug of choice"" - the problem is being a responsible citizen. For every apathetic stoner who gets nothing done, I'm sure I can find an opposite example of someone extremely productive and responsible who enjoys a little reefer once in a while.

My impression is that the reason the NDP is even straddling the fence with this is that the high price will keep usage at more or less current levels.Truly legalization, on all levels, will see a big spike in usage like alcohol saw at the end of prohibition. It took alcohol consumption over 20 years to decline back to pre-Prohibition levels and I don't think any Canadian politician wants to lose an entire generation or two to pot.

7470,1,"What? Well there is one thing I noticed from being a hoodlum teenager. First I will say this. No drug of any quality ever came out of a minority neighborhood. Sorry guys you stomp on your coke too much, your weed is tree bark, and your E is blatant caffeine pills. White people and minorities deal drugs differently from what I have seen.1) In the suburbs everything is word of mouth, no one stands outside and tries to sling their shit. There are no houses blasting music with 8 cars parked outside. Many dealers do not just randomly start taking new customers that want to buy OZ every day. You have to work your way up the ladder. 2) There are no turf wars, everything is supply and demand. If you start losing customers you don't go out and shoot 4 innocent by standers to get to the other guy, you find a better product and get your customers back.3) White people by and large do not embrace a single subculture (other than dumb suburban kids) that identifies with and celebrates criminality. I have seen soccer mom dealers, preacher smokers, golf pro dealers, hick dealers, architects, 4th grade math teachers...the list goes on. Never in my life did I drive down into the seedy section of town and buy off a presentable minority in a three piece suit. Virtually every single time the person fit the profile.I think these three reasons are why cops focus on the minority dealers. They are easy to spot. I don't think cops care so much about drug dealing as they do about how blatant it is or how much crime rises in the neighborhood. Plus it is a money thing, you smash down the door of the wrong house in the suburbs the cops may find themselves giving the rest of their yearly budget to a pissed off home owner and his lawyer. In poor neighborhood, not so much.

There's a big difference between 'recreational' drugs and medicinal drugs.You wouldn't get on a plane built by people who had no training, flown by a pilot who had never had lessons; you shouldn't take a substance prescribed by yourself.I should add, the main focus should always be on treatment, not on incarceration. But go to downtown Baltimore and tell me cheap, legal heroin is a good idea.

"
7730,1,"To suggest that the issue of the government's policy towards a harmless fucking PLANT is anywhere near as important as the issue of upholding the general lawfulness of the government itself is absolutely *INSULTING*.And this is coming from a marijuana user.Drug prohibition is a side-effect of a larger problem with government. Our main concern should be-- no, *must be* government adherence to the Constitution. If that ever happens, the drug prohibition problem will solve itself.

7886,1,"Because an active dose of LSD is very minute, a large number of doses can be synthesized from a comparatively small amount of raw material. Beginning with ergotamine tartrate, for example, one can manufacture roughly one kilogram of pure, crystalline LSD from five kilograms of the ergotamine salt. Five kilograms of LSD — 25 kilograms of ergotamine tartrate — could provide 100 million doses, according to the DEA, more than enough to meet what is believed to be the entire annual U.S. demand. Since the masses involved are so small, concealing and transporting illicit LSD is much easier than smuggling other illegal drugs like cocaine or cannabis.Manufacturing LSD requires laboratory equipment and experience in the field of organic chemistry. It takes two to three days to produce 30 to 100 grams of pure compound. It is believed that LSD is not usually produced in large quantities, but rather in a series of small batches. This technique minimizes the loss of precursor chemicals in case a step does not work as expected.Like I said. My friends with Chemistry degrees don't think it's that difficult to manufacture. I'll go ahead and trust someone with a PhD over some bath tub meth cooker.

7889,1,"""Q: ""Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it, tax it, put age limits on it, and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S.?"" S. Man, DentonA: President-elect Obama is not in favor of the legalization of marijuana. ""What a straight-forward answer, I'd like a little more explaining on the subject but it would just add fuel to the fire for pot activists to play with. Legalizing it is a horrible idea. People all react differently to it and I've seen people have panic attacks over the psychological difference they aren't used to. It is a good idea to kill the war on drugs and decriminalize small amounts of it but making it legal, not a good idea.
