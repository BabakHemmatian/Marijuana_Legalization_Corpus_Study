1,1,"Prescription or not, weed is still a Schedule I narcotic. Therefore, regardless of a state's legality of it, it's still illegal at the Federal level. And Federal law trumps state law.
"
2,1,"Before: U.S. Attorneys (federal prosecutors) could not go after anyone in states where pot is legal, even if that prosecutor wanted to.Now: U.S. attorneys can go after pot if they want to, **even if the state has decided that it should be legal.**Emphasis on the part that shows how against the idea of 'states rights' this policy is. It doesn't necessarily mean that people are going to be prosecuted in CO, WA, etc... but it means that there is less security for people with legal pot businesses because it is now up to the whims of the U.S. attorney in the area.
"
3,1,"yeah i don't mind if colorado kicks the DEA out of the statte, i'm just saying the optics of killing cops over marijuana is the lamest version of a narco state ever.
"
4,1,"I still dont see how the title is incorrect or how the content of the article doesnt reflect it. The reason why the legal pot could flourish is that Obama established a policy to leave potters in legal states alone. Going forward: Will federal agents still have to respect that policy? Or wont they because its simply not there anymore?Thats all it comes down to. This isnt just about money. Be honest with yourself, no one gains anything by defending something even though you dont agree with it.
"
7,1,"I think that it is pretty much a quid pro quo... we'll legalize weed as long as we can tax the hell out of it. That way, states like Colorado can say ""look at all of the good things our weed revenue does!""The funny thing... as far as I can tell... is that legal weed that is taxed like crazy is still cheaper and better quality than black market weed (untaxed).
"
8,1,"Not from US. Weren't South Americans also prejudiced? I thought the ban on marijuana was first made because of South Americans using it.
"
9,1,"Besides being born here to American parents (mother legally immigrated to this country, dad was a white guy born in America) I am an American. Mexico is indeed a shithole. I find it ironic people who are offended by the idea of Mexico being called the shithole it really is usually buy illicit drugs such as pot and coke which perpetuates Mexico being a shithole narco-state run by cartels. Lipservice is rather pathetic. I rather have a loud mouth asshole spout off some mean truth than pay lipservice to fixing some shithole country. Or acting like it's not very much a shithole.
"
10,1,"The only downside to GOP control is that they'll never lass a pot legalization bill.
"
11,1,"Depends on the bag checker you get, some care and enforce rules like that, some don’t. I’ve gotten bag checkers find my weed and not care, it’s all the luck of the draw!
"
12,1,"The primary issues with MPX (a company in a great position otherwise) are that (1) we don't know how Session's ploy against the Cole Memorandum will play out until the pronouncement of the federal budget (which is looking promising considering the congressional bills being pushed to limit Session's capacity for harming the industry); (2) MPX is not allowed to move its weed interstate since, of course, weed consumption/distribution is still illegal at the federal level. However, MPX should have its Canadian LP Licence soon (already they have a 40k sq ft. facility with the capacity to expand to ~400k sq ft). If all goes well with the federal budget pronouncement and MPX announces a successful LP acquisition from Health Canada, the stock should easily bump to $1.05-1.10 and consolidate at that price. That, of course, is entirely speculative, but keep in mind weed is still illegal at the federal level so MPX's reach and thus revenue is still constrained at the moment.
"
13,1,"Reminds me of the time a cop stopped me and my friend smoking cigars in a park after dark (we were like 17 and living at home). Cop: “There wasn’t any marijuana in those cigars, was there?”Friend: “No sir, we don’t believe in marijuana.”Like weed was Santa Claus or something. I still give him shit for it, luckily we didn’t have any.
"
14,1,"It's absurd man. Law enforcement lobbies are right in Phil's pockets. There have even been tweets from the lobyists bragging about how much money they spent in VT to kill the marijuana bill.
"
15,1,"get arrested for smoking weed in your house a lot?
"
16,1,"In early January, Sessions moved in the opposite direction from cannabis legalization when he rescinded the so-called Cole memo, a document drafted under the Obama administration that prioritized other federal crimes over pot possession. Under Sessions’s new guidance, attorneys general across the country can use their own discretion to enforce the Controlled Substance Act.I suppose Sessions thinks its still the eighties. ""Just say NO"" to incarcerating innocent people.
"
17,1,"The GOP don't have ideals or standards or morals, they have talking points and strategies. If you look at the last few decades, you can see this clearly. Deficits and the national debt do not matter to the GOP, it's just a way for them to argue against whatever the Democrats want to do. ""Fiscal responsibility"" just means ""gut the safety net"".The GOP does not, and never has, cared about ""the troops"". That's just a talking point they can trot out to make their opponents sound unpatriotic. But when it comes time to vote to ensure health care for our troops, or to buy them body armor? Those troops can go fuck themselves.States rights? That applies when a state wants to gerrymander away Democratic votes, or ban people from certain restrooms, but not when it comes to marijuana or net neutrality.Christian morality? Super important when we're talking about dangerous brown people, but not so important when they're trying to elect a pedophile or a holocaust denier or a serial adulterer.
"
18,1,"Pretty hard to get a DUI after smoking unless your car smells like weed or you have weed on you. If you can’t function enough to talk to a cop or pass a sobriety test don’t drive. Personally I’ve never felt that way tho
"
19,1,"Why do that when you can smoke however much weed you want? If weed is already legal where you live, then at least scam people out of enough money to buy cool shit and maybe pay off your mortgage, tuition and student debt!
"
20,1,"If you’re an engineer in the defense industry and carry a security clearance you are not be allowed to use weed as it’s still federally illegal. There is one drug test upon hiring and then they ask you during a polygraph.
"
21,1,"I agree what I do with my body and mind is my business, but, and this is a big but, it still remains illegal. If I’m on the street or in a park with a joint and a copper approaches me I’m going to be polite and hopefully nothing more will come of it. If I get mouthy and start going down that route or the ‘free man’ route then I expect something to happen to me, I agree it’s not right but it’s a fact of life that this is going to happen. As I said, I 100% agree with what you are saying, just different ways of tackling it or conducting yourself When it comes to driving, I am well aware of this study, I’ve been smoking weed probably longer than a large proportion of this sub have been alive. Having driven many times stoned in the past, I still cannot condone it, and nowadays I do not smoke after 10pm as I’m driving the next morning at 6am, that’s me, that’s my choice, with the drugalisers they have now my career is not worth the risk should I be pulled over randomly. I have to take very strong painkillers sometimes for my back, I usually take these once a week on a weekend. What I find crazy is that I’m perfectly within the definition of law to drive on those painkillers but not after a smoke, I know which I would rather drive on and it’s not the painkillers. It erks me, it really does, that cannabis is not normalised, legalised, medicinally available etc. My life and that of those around me would be much better if it were. I just hold zero faith that a large proportion of people in this country will ever change their views on it, all the while sneering at is weed smokers over their wine glass

"
24,1,"He related to Milo about how they're both ""unfairly"" persecuted by ~snowflake liberals~ because they both can't handle getting called out for their shitty and antiquated beliefs. Last night he also included a CPAC anti-abortion, anti-women's right ""feminist"" as part of the panel and didn't address it once, she was just a completely normalized and accepted part of that discussion.Controversial guests are not the main reason I dislike Maher though. That is because he's a dusty old dinosaur and doesn't deserve his spot on late night as someone representing progressive ideals in any way in the year 2018.He said last week the new Democratic slogan should be ""Let's go back to the way things were"". He constantly talks about how liberals take their social justice causes ""too far"" and he's on like Week 8 of dismissing the MeToo movement (or making it about himself) for no other reason than because he's an asshole. He also does this in the last few minutes of the show so no one is able to offer a rebuttal to the damaging things he's saying. He's that 1990s-nihilistic-cynical-atheist-libertarian and only cares about causes that directly affect him. Things like marijuana, atheism and racism (probably because he fetishizes WOC). His jokes are tired, even for the 90s. Last night he seriously tried a topical celebrity name-blending joke like anyone's done that in 10 years and most of the other jokes were flops too. it's time for him to go, give his show to someone who is actually able to adjust and change with the times.
"
25,1,"No. If you can be banned for smoking cigarettes ( somePlaces test you for that) then they can dictate whether you smoke weed. If you don’t want to comply or disagree then don’t work there. If it is a monopoly and you have no choice then that is illegal.
"
26,1,"Yeah i don't think different strains is a strong argument really. It was demonized back in the day to help ensure cotton would stay on top as a cash crop for textiles, and as a way to show one's moral superiority. If I were to come up with an honest reason why pot should be illegal it would be the nature of second hand smoke leading to a contact high. You can't get drunk from sitting next to a drinker, but you can eventually get stoned from inhaling smoke in the same room or that wafts up through apartment airvents etc. There would probably have to be some regulations for designated marijuana smoking areas.
"
27,1,"I've never been drug-tested but I've fired multiple people for coming into work if they smell like weed..(In PetCare, Canada. It's still illlegal here.)The pot will show up on your drug test if you smoked within 3 weeks of having it done. Not sure if they will fire you, but you could be written up or suspended.
"
28,1,"The towns will still have a say in this, even if they don't outright ban marijuana businesses. Part of the application process will require prospective businesses to prove that they have support from the towns where they plan to locate.In some towns this will mean cannabis businesses need to get zoning/planning approval before applying for a license. In other cases, written support from a mayor or town council may be enough.-Payton
"
29,1,"> but aside from smoking, are those really risk-taking behaviors? you can have higher N and do so in a safe and non-risky way. i'm not super familiar with health risks, but weed is legal in a lot of places now. how risky are these as opposed to spending a lot of time sitting on the couch/in an office, or eating fatty foods on a regular basis? This is what I really hate about bluepillers - that they constantly cling to outliers as if it was the last bottle of water before an endless desert. Just because something can be done in a perfectly safe fashion doesn't mean that this is the norm. If you meet two totally random people, with one of them being a teetotaler with an N count of 1 and the other being a tattooed weed-smoking guy or girl with an N of 100, of course the latter is far more likely to have a very particular lifestyle and set of values than the former. That this is *still* something that has to be debated over and over again is beyond me.
"
30,1,"There is something to it though, the criminals often use patsies/mules to their stuff for them. If there is someone they know has debt and can't pay rent, they 'offer' them the opportunity to grow weed in their home.But ""Vertrouwelijk contact met een prodeo advocaat als uw hennepplantage opgerold is."" sounds just so casual :)I've also heard of the snow 'problem'. The police now use drones. Not helping of course, I've never of a pot shortage.
"
31,1,"I think Catholic is worse than Mormonism because of how much it interferes with politics. Although in Utah Mormonism does effect state politics like it is with the medical marijuana laws they’re trying to pass. Shit pisses me off.But yeah there’s worse religions than Mormonism imo
"
33,1,"Bill Maher needs to get his head out of his ass. Do I support marijuana legalization? Yes. But do I want an NRA style ""advocacy group"" -- NO WAY. Make no mistake, the NRA is a cult. It gets people to go out and vote against their self interest because they are convinced they are being persecuted. It is actually often showcased as a case study in marketing classes, because of how they have convinced people to associate their sense of self with their guns... a commodity that corporations make money off. Now having a cult go the opposite way is just idiotic. Worse, it distracts from real issues that hurt the working population, regardless of whether they are D or R. Focus on how the tax system, destruction of the safety net, defunding of public schools, and the madness which is this healthcare system, off of which are making it impossible for the working class to have any opportunity for upward mobility. Single payer healthcare is a much more popular issue, even amongst republicans in the working class. Further, it directly affects the lives of ALL people, and the only folks who dont want it are the rich (a group that includes Bill Maher) because of the increased tax burden.
"
34,1,"Our current drug laws are not lax. The new cannabis legislation is not going to be lax. What we need, what we should be worried about, is protection from this kind of abuse of data. That’s what’s concerning me. As for softwood lumber, that issue has been resolved, and then resolved again and then a few more times, we have won every time it’s gone to arbitration but the US refuses to accept the results.

36,1,"As a mid-30's dad who is about to move in with my fiance, who is a full-time mother of two kids, what would be the best type of weed to stay relaxed in the evenings?I'm borderline GAD, and we'd lived together before and I was always on edge since she had a much more loose approach to parenting, which ended up with my always trying to ""keep them in line."" I know there are tons of different strains/methods of consuming now-a-days, and I'm not looking to get baked, just want something that at the end of the day, I can come home to my family and let the kids be kids without triggering my anxiety.Pluses for not having a lingering smell!edit: also in Southern California, so finding it through even legal means is not an issue. I have friends with cards, and it's largely available to public now anyway (albeit more expensive).
"
37,1,"Fear mongering isn't necessarily a bad thing. The links between driving impairment/psychosis and marijuana usage are real. I'm pro legalization, but also pro getting the message out there that people need to be careful with their pot use.
"
38,1,"Vapor brothers vaporizer is nice, I don't notice the *stank* like I do with smoke.Smoked after long time of not smoking and was like ""Ho-ly-shit!""e-Pens are pretty good.If you are in a legal state you can get suppository, you and your husband can have an erotic pot pooper poking pill pushing party. You can make a tincture with alcohol (burns) or oils and put drops under your tongue or use as sex lube, whatever. Don't use alcohol as sex lube.Edibles should be ingested at night after dinner so you don't get overly stoned, sleep off the stoneage, enjoy the relaxing pain free benefits during your waking hours.
"
40,1,"Oh, I get it now. Yr lawyer got yr weed possession case dismissed so obvs therefore our 4th amendment rights are fully intact, and not actively under threat by a burgeoning police or surveillance state. You know, like China.Can we agree that what we ultimately want is not is having any government - US, Chinese, you name it - in our phones, surveilling us?
"
41,1,"Yes you’re right. What I was referring to was blaming the guy who stole it for smoking weed in it. The cops aren’t going to care what you bought it for, only what it was used for.
"
43,1,"Dam that sucks. Where I live cops hate putting people in jail for weed they say that they have better things to do with their time and would rather spend time going after more important cases like rape, stealing etc, So where I live the cops are trying to make it legal or at least decriminalize it. Doesn't mean that cops from other states or cities can't put me in jail though. Hence why I don't really trust these Facebook people.
"
44,1,"Nope and the firefighters for this area along with the police are aware of my medical conditions and weed already.
"
45,1,"No, I-502 was amended a couple years after passage to specifically prohibit social consumption. You can't even open a vape lounge or allow people to consume edibles in public. They're even cracking down on [CBD lattes](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2018/05/21/26335861/bainbridge-cafe-ordered-to-stop-selling-cbd-lattes). We have the most stringent cannabis regulations among legal states.
"
47,1,"Sooo....just like all the posts asking where to find storefronts that sell weed? *eyeroll* I'm sure the CRA swat team is scouring Reddit for cash workers. /sAnd technically, asking for, working for, accepting cash for any work is not illegal. Once you file your return and not claim it, only THEN has the illegal act been commited. So asking for 'cash work' is not going to draw out anti-fraud task force. And do you really think any LEO is going to find the actual person behind the username? I guess you think all the torrent downloaders are going to be rounded up any time now, eh?
"
48,1,"Why shouldn't he question your intelligence? Your the one saying weed should be prohibited because some person you know cant sleep without it. You know caffeine and alcohol cause insomnia as well as any kind of sleeping pill once dependence forms. Has your retard doctor ever considered that your friend has an actual sleep disorder and is using weed to compensate? Have either of you ever even consumed? lol

49,1,"Thank goodness our marijuana laws are reasonable. We can self medicate our firearm sorrows.
"
50,1,"If Snoop Dogg ever gets long cancer, I’ll concede your point. He smokes multiple ounces of weed a day, and has for decades. That’s literally like... more than a carton/day equivalent. And he seems to be doing just fine, as have all the other thousands of people who smoked similar amounts.So no, it’s not because people don’t report it. Believe me, if there were ONE documented instance, in world history, of someone getting lung cancer from smoking marijuana, it would be front page news worldwide. The people in power who want to stop it from being decriminalized have WAY too much at stake to just let that stuff go by unreported.
"
51,1,"I get that but the stigma around it definitely doesn't help. A lot of people are forced to hide it and will often hang round with others who smoke as well just so they can be open about it. I think legalisation will help kill the stigma a bit and could make smokers feel like they're actually members of society again. I work with a guy who would get the sack if our boss found out he smoked and he's been smoking it for 30+ years now. He's great at his job as well. It's not fair that people should be shunned for a lifestyle choice as harmless as weed, especially if it's causing no harm.
"
52,1,"Yeah my dads in chronic pain and an alcoholic who was sober for thirty fucking years. Now he's only been sober for two months after drinking a fuck tonne to help with his pain because his opiates aren't enough (Who fucking knew the same dose for 5 years wont be as good because of this thing called developing a tolerance).He'd try pot, but the last thing you want to do when you're an invalid in chronic agonizing pain is risk going to fucking prison or getting a massive fine. So he tried drinking again, fucked that up royally and is now back in the same situation.You know somethings fucked up if your treatment plan is so shit the 30 year sober alcoholic tries drinking again. People sober that long don't just start drinking again out of the blue for no reason. But hey, at least uni students get a free first year instead of funding the DHB's adequately, those are the real priorities.
"
53,1,"> It's not like democrats are somehow looking out for anyone other than themselves. Everyone is just looking out for the biggest pay-day.Sounds like projecting, to me.How exactly do things like gay rights, pro-choice policies, better sex education in schools, less military spending, better access to women's healthcare including contraceptives, and decriminalization of marijuana directly benefit me as a straight white dude that doesn't do drugs?You sound like you're either young or lack empathy.There could be an argument made that these things indirectly benefit me by making us a happier and better off society. But if you boil things down that far that we're starting to talk about someone's subconscious factors to making a decision then the waters become far too muddy and it devolves into a philosophy argument.
"
54,1,"ALL drug laws move it BACKWORDS ifwanted peaople to not smoke pot it should never been made illegal. look at phenibut and others that are rarely done and mostly unknown.... now if they make them illegal think about how much use may go UP plus being cut with unsafe stuffs on the street. when pot was made illegal its use went WAY UP.

58,1,"> The left does this at least as much. I can't tell you have many times I""ve seen people called a racist because they disagreed with Obama's policies.I'd like to see examples of people being straight-up called a racist for disagreeing with *policy*. I've seen that claimed a lot, and haven't seen it myself.And, you fundamentally misunderstand what I'm trying to say. The left does not *deify* Obama in the same way as the right does with Reagan. Not even remotely close. You can throw a rock on this very website and find scores of people who disagree with a shit ton of his policy *(droning, not closing Gitmo, not pulling us out of the middle east, not legalizing marijuana, milquetoast stance on gay marriage, bank bailouts, I could go on)* Try to find that kind of criticism of Reagan on the right, in particular with folks who actually lived as an adult through his presidency.Granted his personal life, demeanor, and charisma were top-notch. But as a policy maker and political icon, Obama's certainly not woven into the fabric of the liberal being. And despite being the first black president, I do not believe for even a second that his presidency will have the historical impact and profundity of Reagan's.And food for thought, if the crazy partisanship that Reagan's presidency gave birth to never happened in the first place, do you think liberals would have such a knee-jerk reaction to criticism of Obama? (That's what this is about)

They can search your vehicle anyway, but you can't be arrested for not consenting.It matters in court.

You'd probably have a good case against that being an unreasonable search.

"
65,1,"Let's start with where you're wrong.> There's also other warrants made public which show that all the cops were doing was collecting evidence. ""There have been several warrants signed by judges and executed in this case aside from the arrest warrant for Guyger and the search warrant signed September 7 that were returned to the court on Thursday. The others are still sealed and not accessible.""From your own first ""warrant"" source. By the way.When the warrant, listing the weed, was made public. It was BEFORE the other warrants were unsealed. Why release the contents of only one warrant? Why not release them all at the same time? Remembering that the cops have the choice of keeping them sealed, for the first 31 days, and a further 30 days after that.So. Once again. Yes. The cops are the ones who made it publicly available in the court. It wasn't ""picked up by the lawyers"". I notice you haven't responded to me pointing that out yet.Also. It was, like I said, Fox that first reported on it. https://twitter.com/fox4/status/1040361795519541249This headline, highlighting marijuana being found in his apartment, was the original headline of the Fox news article you posted in fact. You'll notice the updated portion of their own posting timeline.So. Let's go back.Was this ""tidbit"" picked up by the lawyers representing the family?No. It was first reported by Fox news, with the leading headline highlighting the weed in his place.Did they run with it?Also no. Fox news did. The lawyers response, to an obviously inflammatory headline, is to call it out. Any half decent lawyer would do this.Did the cops have to make it public?Again. No. They had a choice. And it's an odd one considering they made that one public a full day before any other.Now. Maybe it's you who should check your own sources and learn to deal in facts. I've only dealt with facts since the beginning. There's no emotion in me pointing out who reported on what and when. There is emotion however, in your response. Where you highlighted the one thing you got right, that they listed other stuff on the warrant. Which also happened to be the one thing I wasn't pointing out you being wrong about. I was never contending that. I was contending the rest.Which you still haven't responded too.

75,1,"> If i said black fathers were holding back society because statistically they leave more often, i would lose my job due to a twitter mob.Because you would have completely ignored the enormous disadvantages black men face and the endless drug war that disproportionately and unfairly criminalizes black men and reduces their ability to be fathers. Hard to be a dad when you're less likely to be employed with the same resume, more likely to go to prison for smoking marijuana, more likely to get a longer sentence, more likely to be stopped and frisked, more likely to be wrongly convicted, get less pay for the same job, and on and on and on and on.When the deck is stacked against you, it's harder to be a stable father figure. If you blame black men for those societal inequities, yeah you're a racist. The entire point of my original post was to get redditors, who are again largely young white guys, to rethink their tendency to blame old people for everything. Apparently you cannot do that. Your reflexive defensiveness makes it impossible for you to be introspective, even for a second. Sorry you're so ignorant and defensive.

78,1,"Look if they get to your edibles you dun fucked up horribly you irresponsible stoner giving the industry a bad image.(generalizing, not a personal jab) I'm not trying to shrug it off, I can definitely image the horror and potential damage, but, ok hold on, I just wanna see if I can find that stat. I don't know why I said you need to wait since you'll get this whenever I'm done....anyway! On to [depressing stuff](https://www.cdc.gov/medicationsafety/protect/protect_initiative.html) >Approximately 60,000 emergency department (ED) visits result from unintentional medication overdoses among children under the age of 5;>One out of every 150 two-year-olds is treated in an ED for an unintentional medication overdose;>Over 90% of ED visits for unintentional medication overdoses among children under the age of 5 involve children who get into medicine on their own without caregiver oversight>Approximately 5% of ED visits for unintentional medication overdoses among children under the age of 5 are due to medication errors. A common error is when caregivers measure and give too much medicine by mistake.That's some terrifying stats, and should be a warning, a clarion call for responsible cannabis users to not fuck this up. There was an extremely misleading [toddler weed overdose who died](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/7xww7q/those-headlines-about-a-babys-weed-overdose-death-are-totally-wrong) and I can assure you the anti cannabis lot is still repeating it.>In 2015, there were 30 million ED visits for children aged 18 years or younger, with a rate of 382.9 per 1,000 population. The vast majority of these visits (96.7 percent) were treat and release. >Sixteen kids age 9 and younger went to the Children’s ER for marijuana in 2015, and, even with the post-legalization jump, marijuana exposure cases account for about six out of every 1,000 emergency room visits for ingestions, according to the study. Marijuana-related poison-control calls for kids 9 and younger make up about two out of every 1,000 calls, the study reports.As for opioids.....hmm it's hard to find stats for toddlers or under 10s specifically, hmm, [this will do I guess](https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/data/sites/default/files/report_3398/ShortReport-3398.html) Unfortunately it includes other household items as well. >Every day, about 300 children are poisoned in the United States.2 Many of these poisonings occur because of accidental ingestion (i.e., children taking medications when parents/caregivers are not looking or parents accidentally giving children the wrong medication. The percentage of admitted children who ultimately died from opioid overdose also decreased to 1.3% between 2012 and 2015 from 2.8% between 2004 and 2007. So, fortunately, no deaths related to weed overdoses thus far. But anyhow, like I said, kids shouldn't be allowed near drugs, and this should be a warning for users to be more careful. (check other comments, not a 100% puritan here)
"
79,1,"True. I wonder how much property damage is caused every year by drunk assholes.I know that prohibition didn't work but you can understand why they tried it. What causes more unneeded death, disease, and damage than alcohol? It impairs judgement and it's so incredibly wide-spread, yet we can't seem to do anything about the massive damage it does to society. It's a pretty fascinating problem that can be best described as ""A worldwide drug dependency problem"".Other drugs do kill and cause crime, but booze is the main drug that the actual users of it tend to become a problem, as the local cops learn every night downtown around 1am when another brawl starts. I'll tell you I never wanted to smash bottles on the side of a building or punch a random dude while smoking weed.Again I'm not saying we should bring back prohibition or anything. But it does feel like we should do *something* when so many die either from alcohol directly each year or, more tragically, kill the innocent in acts of violence both accidental and intentional, from drunk driving and drunk stabbings. It's kind of like gun control where people just act like it's too big of a problem to do anything about at this point - this is just the way it is.

81,1,"I believe in *this* weed. I do not believe in the weed that is grown unregulated.
"
82,1,"I know what you mean, but one of the reasons there are barely any videos involving weed is *because it’s not legal in most places.* Until recently, there was nowhere in the US you could legally walk into a store and buy marijuana (unless you had a medical card).
"
83,1,"I mean, it does actually make sense to have drugs be a consistent federal thing -- it means that- Only one group has to go through the agonizing process of classifying every imaginable substance. Say, how dangerous is ""5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindan""? If you had 50 different states going through this process independently, that would be incredibly inefficient.- you don't have awkward issues where substance legality jumps around as you transport it across state lines. Yes, I know that kinda is the case for marijuana now, but that's an argument *for* making it federally uniformly legal rather than per-state.----Note that my first point is a little weak, because if it *was* per-state, most of the work would still be centralized. An example is state fire codes -- they usually ""adopt by reference"" a single central document (usually NFPA in this case), and then provide a list of state-specific changes to it.
"
85,1,"Voters have legalized weed via ballot initiatives not politicians.
"
86,1,"Right? Legalizing weed makes such much sense from every perspective. Fiscally-- save money from prisons, improve economy because more people can get federal loans for college and less people are ex-conn. Morally-- marijuana offenses used to impoverish black and latino communities, put non violent people over every race into prison. Medically-- so much evidence that it's a good alternative to opioid pain treatment. I don't even smoke weed but even I support users. What reasons are there to keep it illegal aside form ""it's been that way for a long time""?

91,1,") VFF is one of the biggest produce businesses in North America for the last thirty years. They have a stellar management team that has been able to generate profit even with razor thin margins vs Mexico. These guys have been running a large scale business long before MJ was even a sparkle of an idea to any of these other companies.2) VFF has 4.5 million Sq ft in Delta bc. One of the best growing climates in all of Canada. Check the avg temperature for the area in winter it's comical vs these other places. It's not cheap to heat a large scale greenhouse.3) Speaking of heat, and now I'll also bring up electricity, VFF has their own methane co generation power plant. That's right. They own their own power.4) EMH does have 50% of the profit from this JV. EMH is guaranteeing buying 60% of total harvest for all of 2019. The remaining 40% will be sold to LP that need extra/they will start to do their own vertically integrated branding and selling.5) ace up the sleeve is the 5 mil sq ft in Texas. It's a matter of when not if the USA goes legal they will be able to quickly replicate what they're doing now in Delta.6) VFF will evaluate and potentially convert an additional 1-3 mil sq ft that's still doing tomatoes in Delta. In the meantime they'll have 1 mil done by year end (they have 500k so far) they got their license March and sales license July 30. So they converted half a million Sq ft in 6 months. Not sure many LP can say that. Again seasoned experienced staff make the difference7) VFF will still make money off their produce businesses in Texas in meantime. This is a food play not just a MJ play. They survived 09 for a reason.Overall these guys are going to kill it. In greenhouses and equipment alone their NAV is 150-200 million. VFF is tremendous value and still being valued as a food play not a weed play. That's going to change quickly in next few months.P.s as a bonus tip look at who they just hired for the CEO JV. It's the guy who was leading the LCBO weed division that's now out of a job. Has a great history and serious connections.My target is 30 bucks which puts us at 1.5 billion market cap and I think I'm being conservative. If Texas goes through as I think it will in a few years I'm going to retire

"
94,1,"Yes it depends on the state for protections like you have in IL but federally it’s still illegal to obtain or possess firearms. I guess it depends on what agency shows up at your door, local/state or federal. In Hawaii the police have access to the medical database and can cross check it with gun owners. In theory only doctors will have access to the patient database in Ohio so law enforcement has no way to cross check. It’s the honor system when buying a firearm. Of course it’s a felony to lie on the form but they have no way to check. The different state and federal laws can get really messy too. What would happen if you came from IL to Ohio to hunt with your legal to own in IL guns and decided you wanted to buy some medical marijuana from an Ohio dispensary using your medical card for the week you were here. Then you were pulled over by an OH state patrol and found with a vaporizer, medical marijuana, and your hunting rifle. You’d be fine if you were in IL but not in OH. We don’t know how they’re going to enforce it yet. It could be a felony. Maybe it won’t. Or maybe worse you get pulled over by an IN state patrol where they don’t have legal medical marijuana. Maybe you don’t have any medical marijuana on you because you vaped it all on your hunting trip but the officer notices your medical card when you give him your ID and now you’re looking at illegal firearms and paraphernalia. You’d think the pro gun Ohio government would provide some protections like IL. But the same pro gun Ohio government is also very anti-marijuana so it’s just as likely they won’t provide any protection. If the federal government would change the designation there wouldn’t be any need for individual states to waste time, money, and resources providing or not providing protections for medical marijuana gun owners.

96,1,"To be honest my profession isn't one that really benefits from my clients knowing I smoke cannabis. I welcome the potential legalisation, but I'll still keep it on the down low.

98,1,"Can't believe this is so highly upvoted... This claim has been disproven time and time again. There is no chance of developing physical dependency on cannabis. The withdrawal people face from quitting hard drugs, booze, caffine, and tobacco simply doesn't happen when a daily pot user stops smoking. You can of course become psychologically addicted to anything, including cannabis, but that's not physical dependency. Spreading information that this harmless, medicinal plant is dangerous is simply insulting to those who benefit from it's uses, and those who have had their lives attacked because of it's illegally.
"
99,1,"I think there is some truth to that. But it’s also a truism; most people, in general, are sheep that don’t have the time or aptitude to evaluate things like politics very critically.That said, the Republican party has been trending less and less religiously/socially conservative. I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump got a ton of support for legalizing weed and having some moderate pro-life stuff (early term, danger to mother etc.). I think young Republicans are very ready to take on more libertarian ideas especially relative to the past. Eg. TD is obsessed with Sowel, Friedmans spiritual predecessor. And NO, it’s not just because he agree with Trump on a bunch of things. I wish libertarians would just recognize that Friedman was right on immigration; you have to regulate immigration if you have a welfare system. Not to mention importing those who vote for more entitlements doesn’t exactly help libertarian causes. I think that’s one issue that really prevents Rs from embracing more libertarian ideas.

5,0,"When I was a kid, my dad was the arbiter of justice. That's not to say that my mom wasn't capable of punishing us - she would, but her spankings were fewer, more far between and less intense than spankings from my dad. Don't get me wrong - I can count the total times my parents collectively spanked me on my hands (and maybe a few toes..)(side note: my brother was a goddamn angel and got spanked maybe twice in our childhood), but it was **never** violent, and they **never** ""beat"" me. Never a mark left behind, and afterwards, always a conversation about why it happened and what I could do to prevent it from happening later. But I learned to *listen.*I had friends that had dads (in my personal experience, it was always the dad) that tried to be a friend more than a parent. Would be super lax on any rules Mom had set, would go behind her back and approve of shit she would never approve of, tried to be the ""cool parent."" And they **were** the cool parents! Your dad let's you smoke weed and sneak out of the house?! WTF MY DAD DOESN'T DO THAT!But in the end, the (three or four) kids who I knew with parents like that ended up majorly fucking up later in life. I mean I've had my fair share of fuck ups but with them it was shit like DUI's, problems with authority and so on. Nothing life-ending, but enough of a problem that their lives (or the possibility of success) was, at the very least, limited after some of the activities in their youth. I'm not advocating hitting your kids, but disciplinary measures need to be made in the early ages to truly lead your kids to any possibility of success. You said it best - a parent should *not* be a ""friend.""

But lately the paranoia is affecting my breakthrough potential. I’m wondering if my chakras are unbalanced and the paranoia is there to block me. I’ve been getting pretty deep with weed.

39,0,"She’s not an ex-best friend yet...I’m trying to figure out how to kind of depart from the relationship.We met in college when I was heart broken over my break up with my boyfriend of 4 years.We knew of each other from school, but we met through mutual friends in college and starting hanging out. We smoked a ton of weed, moved in together with 2 other roomies and starting lifeguarding together during the summer. We would drink on the job, blow off work, and steal snacks from the snack stand (typical broke college kid stuff).It’s been 8 years and while we were cool to chill in college, I feel like she is holding me down. I got back together with my ex boyfriend, we moved into a house and we are now engaged and I am very happy. But she is still smoking copious amounts of weed, making irresponsible work choices and has been miserably single or in a weird/kinda relationships. She is really mean and horrible to men and super insecure. She’s stuck in her ways and will continuously argue about how you’re dumb and how she’s done research on it and she’s right. She can never be happy or congratulatory to anyone else’s success and she is so incredibly needy. I have found myself playing her best friend/counselor/boyfriend/parent/entertainment on any given day. She tells me all about her day and her problems and I try to listen and give the best advice or encouraging words but it is NEVER reciprocated. I am just so stuck because she literally has NO one else. She doesn’t make friends easy, a dude won’t touch her with a 10 ft pool (not because of her looks, but because of her personality) and I don’t know how to back away without feeling like a piece of shit. She’s not close with her mom, her dad was jailed when she was 3 and she doesn’t have any real relationships with her step sisters. Things are just too much with her. I’m her best friend, but I don’t think I can call her mine - she’s more of like a needy ex that I can’t seem to get rid of. She’s thinking about looking for a job in another state, and I hope to god she finds one 😕

42,0,"My view on thing: 1. Energy saving/binging... I'd just let it go, she has to do someting and the energy spend really isn't worth the drama.2. \+ 3. food/sharing/finishing the same as smoking your weed must be adressed, and immediatly. Tell her straight away that you are fine with her living with you, but that you aren't sharing your life with her, only your appartment. Keep your weed in your room, tell her she needs to buy her own food and drincs. Clean up a part of you fridge and have her store her food separate from your. 4. Same goes for the chores, as she doesn't pay rent she should at least do her part in the house. Make a plan together, write down the chores you like \- for example, I HATE cleaning the kitchen, but I'm totaly fine cleaning the toilet. \(I suggest slitting up the chores, you always do the toilet, she always vapors the floor. Otherwise you'll just end up with not so clean areas that you have to doubleclean when it's your turn\). Also, to soften the blow talk about how the situation is hard on both of you. She is your dear friend, but this is still your place and you are used to having it on your own. Now you share it with her and the both of you need to find an agreement for the next weeks. And try to be ok with some compromises. I had a hard time when I had a guy move into my appartment after 7 years of ""ruling it on my own"" \(work cut to half time cause I took up studies, money low for 2 year :\). He felt like an intruder in my place! Try to be ok even if not everything is exactly how it used to be \(that's why I think you should let the energy\-saving go\). I wish you and your friend the best!

46,0,"**Website is broken for me so I'll summarise the case here:** Two boys, Don Henry and Kevin Ives, go hunting at night. Four hours later, a freight train is making its usual run through the area. The driver sees two boys lying on the ground in parallel on the tracks. A green tarp is laid over them. The driver blows the train's horn multiple times but the boys do not respond. The driver initiates an emergency stop, but it is too late. The two boys are run over.**FIRST INVESTIGATION**The state opens a case and the boys are found in autopsy to have smoked *twenty marijuana cigarettes each*(Some of you have pointed out that this isn't a feasible test. All I know is that the medical examiner ruled this). The medical examiner theorises that they were asleep due to the weed, and laid down on the tracks because they were high. The boys' families take issue with this investigation: the boys had no history of drug use, they didn't believe their sons would sleep through the loud horn of the train, or lie down on the tracks in the first place. Don Henry's rifle was found lying on the gravel by the tracks, and his father believed that his son would never leave his prized firearm to be scratched by the gravel.The families hire a PI, who is met with great resistance by the local police. The families hold a press conference after the police refuse to co-operate or change their ruling of **""accidental death""**. The case is reopened. **SECOND INVESTIGATION**A new pathologist finds that the boys had only smoked 1-3 joints each. He also finds that one boy was dead, with the other unconscious prior to them being run over. The deaths are ruled as **""probable homicides""** instead of accidental death.The *shirt* of one of the boys (the already dead one) is analysed, who finds tears indicating stab wounds, suggesting that he was stabbed to death before being laid on the tracks. The new autopsy also suggests that the other boy had head trauma indicating he had been knocked out by a blunt object, such as the butt of his rifle. Investigators start wondering about the green tarp. Multiple witnesses on the train confirm seeing it, but the police deny having been told about it. The train driver insists that he told them during his first interview with them. The tarp is never found.The case is found to be similar to the deaths of two boys three years prior, however the case remains unsolved.A week before the boys were killed, an unidentified man wearing military fatigues was spotted in the vicinity of the tracks. His behavior had aroused suspicion. Police officer Danny Allen stopped to question the man. Suddenly, he opened fire on officer Allen. The area was searched, but the man was never found.One the night the boys were killed, witnesses again saw the man in military fatigues. This time, he was leaving town, heading down a road less than 200 yards from the spot where the boys were later run over. Police have been unable to locate or identify him.The area is also a drug trafficking hub, leading many to believe that they came across something they shouldn't have seen. Accusations of a police cover up have also been made. After some time, a local witness later came forward, claiming that on the night of the murders, he saw two police officers beating two boys senseless in a store parking lot before tossing them into a truck and driving away. It is unknown whether or not they were Kevin and Don.Still no killer has been found.EDIT: clarification

90,0,"Glad to hear that you’re back being sober from weed. I’ve gone through a similar process before quitting weed many times...I was even trying to keep it to weekends only which would only last 2-3 weeks before it became a daily thing again. I think there is a lesson to be learned here. We are such prisoners to our thoughts and identify at such a deep level...so as soon as the thought of smoking comes up we immediately think it is us and can not control the urge. In reality thoughts are just a memory bank that continue to churn based on the habits we have formed, the way in which we view the world and ourselves.
