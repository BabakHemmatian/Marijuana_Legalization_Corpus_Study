# Genericity, Boundedness, Aspect Models Development

The python notebook in this directory contains the code used to develop the genericity, aspect, and boundedness models. To run the code, you would need to provide the correct path to the human annotated documents folder and the sitent folder. 

You can get the sitent data from this [repo](https://github.com/annefried/sitent/tree/master/annotated_corpus)
