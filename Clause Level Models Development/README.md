# Genericity, Boundedness, Aspect Models Development

The python notebook in this directory contains the code used to develop the genericity, aspect, and boundedness models. To run the code, you would need to provide the correct path to the human annotated documents folder and the sitent folder. 

You can get the sitent data from this [repo](https://github.com/annefried/sitent/tree/master/annotated_corpus)

## Files in this directory -

1. Situaton_Entity_Type_Models.ipynb - This file contains code used for the development of the Genericity, Aspect, and Boundedness classification models. This includes preprocessing of the Sitent dataset as well as the annotated corpus from the Reddit dataset, the model architecture, training and testing code, and saved metrics of test runs.
