The `sentiment_doi_correlation.py` computes Point Biserial correlation between 
Text Blob sentiment results, Vader sentiment results, and average
sentiment results and both domains of interest, attitude and persuasion (human ratings). 
Note this can be configured for inferred ratings.

The only prerequisite for running this is the reddit_50_both_inferred.db file.
